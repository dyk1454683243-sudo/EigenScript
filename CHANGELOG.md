## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

- **A thread handle is joined exactly once, and a full handle table raises
  (#1146).** `thread_join` now *claims* the handle — it resolves the id and
  detaches the table slot under one hold of the handle mutex, then waits
  outside it — so a second join, sequential or concurrent, raises a catchable
  `value` error (`thread_join: thread handle N has already been joined`) instead
  of answering `null`. Handles also carry the slot's GENERATION (`_handle_gen`,
  `_channel_gen`, `_store_gen`; socket ids pack it into the number), so a
  handle held across a full 255-slot recycle raises `stale thread handle`
  instead of silently naming a different thread. And `spawn`, `channel`,
  `task_spawn`, `store_open` and the socket builtins raise a catchable `limit`
  error when the shared 255-slot table is full instead of returning `null`
  behind a line on stderr. Programs that tested a spawn result for `null`, or
  that relied on a repeated join answering `null`, must use `try`/`catch`.
  Cooperative task ids are the one declared exception to the generation rule —
  a task id is a plain number with nowhere to carry one; tracked as #1173, see
  docs/CONCURRENCY.md (a JOINED task never releases its slot on any version, so
  that ABA is reachable only through `task_detach`).

  **Every store builtin refuses a handle it cannot resolve, and a stale handle
  SAYS "stale".** `store_get`, `store_query`, `store_count`, `store_delete`,
  `store_update`, `store_drop`, `store_collections`, `store_put` and
  `store_close` all raise a catchable `value` error instead of answering
  `null`/`0`/`[]`. **This moves a DEFAULT-PATH answer, with `EIGS_STRICT` off**:
  `store_delete`, `store_count`, `store_drop` and `store_update` answered `0`
  for a non-handle argument and now raise, and `tools/strict_differential.sh`'s
  identical-when-off half reports those four as `differing` against a v0.43.0
  parent — deliberately, because that tool has no waiver mechanism and a moved
  default-path answer is a semantics change rather than a waiver. Pinned by
  `tests/test_handle_forge.eigs`. — `tests/test_handle_forge.eigs`'s two "returns null"
  assertions changed to "raises" for exactly this reason, and `store_close` no
  longer blanks `_store_id` (the generation already refuses the handle, and
  with a better diagnosis: `store handle 1 has already been closed` rather than
  a generic invalid-handle error). One formatter
  (`handle_raise_unresolved`) words the refusal for every kind, so a stale
  thread, channel and store handle are refused in the same four shapes:
  "already been joined/closed", "stale ... handle (slot N no longer holds the
  ... this handle names)", "handle N is not a ... handle", and the unchanged
  "invalid channel"/"invalid store" for a value that is not a handle at all.

- **Documentation examples are checked opt-OUT, and doc numbers are derived,
  not typed.** Two mechanical gates replace hand sweeps:
  - **`tests/test_doc_examples.py` (suite [89]) now EXECUTES every
    `eigenscript` fence** in README.md, docs/llms.txt and ten `docs/*.md`.
    The old rule ran a fence only if an author paired it with an ```output
    block: 98 of 180 fences ran, docs/SYNTAX.md 0 of 35, docs/PREDICATES.md
    0 of 13, docs/llms.txt 0 of 4. **Breaking for doc authors:** an untagged
    fence with no `output` block now FAILS the suite. The tag grammar is
    ```` ```eigenscript ```` (paired, byte-compared), ````
    ```eigenscript fragment i=0 xs=[1,2] ```` (run with those free names
    bound; must finish with a clean exit and clean stderr), and ````
    ```eigenscript nocheck <reason> ```` (not run; the reason is required on
    the same line). The un-reasoned `eigenscript skip` spelling is GONE — its
    five uses became `nocheck` with reasons or runnable fragments. Populations
    are pinned per file and cross-checked against an independent line scan.
    Result: 179 fences, 175 executed, 4 `nocheck` with stated reasons.
  - **`tools/docs_claims_check.sh` (suite [99za])** derives every numeric
    claim, backticked repo path, `eigenscript --flag`, `make <target>` and
    backticked `name of` call in README.md, docs/llms.txt, CLAUDE.md,
    docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/BUILTINS.md from the tree. Anything not
    derived must be waived by its exact line content with a reason. The three
    number checks in `tools/doc_drift_check.sh` (README stdlib headline,
    ARCHITECTURE lib/ count, builtin counts) moved into it — numeric doc
    claims have ONE home now.
  - Numbers fixed by the first run: the minimal binary is **943K**, not
    "~620K" (a 2026-04-24 claim); the GUI toolkit registers **47** widgets,
    not 44; `lib/` holds **78** modules, not 52 (the README table gained the
    8 missing non-fragment modules and declares the 18 `lib/ui_*.eigs`
    fragments, 60 + 18 = 78); **17** STEM modules, defined for the first time
    by a machine-readable `# stdlib-tag: stem` header cross-checked against
    docs/STDLIB.md's own section; the suite has **266 sections**, not "2,500+
    checks"; docs/llms.txt claims **349 builtins (261 core + 88 extensions)**,
    not "~255"; CLAUDE.md calls docs/llms.txt **260** lines, not 190. Six
    dangling paths (`lib/ui`, `lib/test`, `lib/log`, and three cross-repo
    references) were corrected.
  - **CLAUDE.md's same-PR rule now names four documents**: a semantics change
    updates `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/COMPARISON.md`, `README.md` and
    `docs/llms.txt`, and the two gates above are the mechanism.
  - README's opening paragraph states what is true about concurrency today
    (OS threads, channels, `thread_join`, the documented memory model in
    docs/CONCURRENCY.md, open items in #1153) instead of "real concurrency".
  - **docs/CONCURRENCY.md's headline rule was FALSE and is corrected.** It said
    "messages copy, closures share"; a `buffer` or a `text_builder` sent
    through a channel is shared BY REFERENCE, so the receiver sees the
    sender's later mutations (`send` a buffer, then `buf_set` it, and the
    receiver reads the new value). That is open defect **#1148** under #1153.
    The rule is now "VALUES copy, HANDLES share", the counterexample and the
    explicit-snapshot workaround are both EXECUTED examples with byte-compared
    output, and the README sentence matches. A gate that proves numbers and
    runs examples does not prove an English sentence; this one was found by
    executing the sentence.
  - **docs/CONCURRENCY.md's copy-vs-share taxonomy is MEASURED, not listed.**
    The corrected page said "three things" share; a reviewer found a fourth by
    sending a channel through a channel. The page now carries one executed
    example that sends a value of each kind, mutates the sender, asks the
    receiver what it sees, and PRINTS the verdict per kind — the enumeration is
    the program's byte-compared output, so a kind that changes sides fails the
    build. `chan_clone_rec`'s switch-arm count (10, no `default:`, so
    `-Werror=switch` already forces the C decision) is now derived by
    `tools/docs_claims_check.sh`, so adding a `ValType` fails the page too.
    docs/llms.txt — the file every agent primes on — gained the rule and its
    own paired example; it previously carried no copy/share sentence at all.
  - **bash 3.2 counts parentheses inside a quoted heredoc**, so
    `TABLE=$(cat <<'EOF' … )` breaks when a row contains an unbalanced `(` —
    which a row of reviewed prose eventually does. Both such tables in the
    docs-claims gate are now DATA FILES (`tools/docs_claims_waivers.txt`,
    `tools/docs_claims_populations.txt`), immune to apostrophes, backticks and
    parentheses at once. A pre-existing bash 3.2 break in
    `tools/werror_switch_check.sh` (an unquoted `(` group in a `[[ =~ ]]`
    pattern, reachable on the main-lane macOS job) is fixed the same way.
    New suite section **[99zb]** parses every tracked `*.sh` under the oldest
    bash on the machine and announces itself when there is none.
  - **A failing doc gate now prints the tool's own words.** Both sections
    (`[89]`, `[99za]`) echo the captured output's last 20 lines verbatim with
    the exit code instead of grepping for `^RED`, which a parse error or an
    early exit matches neither; both tools print a one-line environment banner
    (shell/python version, make, uname, selected binary, release-binary
    presence) on every run; and `docs_claims_check.sh` names itself on every
    non-zero exit path, including an EXIT trap for a death that never reached a
    verdict. A macOS failure went two CI rounds without its reason ever
    reaching the log.
  - **The binary-size claim names its variant, and a lane that cannot verify it
    DEFERS rather than skips.** It measured `src/eigenscript`, a hard link to
    the last-built variant, so the ASan shard measured the ASan binary and
    reported "claims '940K' but D_BIN_K derives 28721". It is now verified
    against `build/release/eigenscript` only; where that is absent the claim
    becomes a pinned deferral (`RELEASE_ONLY_DECLARED=1`), so a deferral cannot
    multiply unnoticed. **And then no lane verified it**: every CI leg builds
    with `./build.sh`, which writes `src/eigenscript` directly, so
    `build/release/` never existed in CI and the claim deferred everywhere —
    a documentation number with no verifier, inside the gate that exists to
    abolish those. The lane's binary is now identified BY INODE: if
    `src/eigenscript` shares one with a `build/<variant>/eigenscript` the
    variant names itself (only `release` is accepted, anything else defers);
    if it shares one with none, it is the `./build.sh` product, which is
    exactly what `install.sh` puts on a user's machine, and it is MEASURED.
    A non-Linux lane defers too — a Mach-O of the same source is a different
    object format, not documentation drift. Every state has its own planted
    selftest row.
  - **No scan that feeds a population suppresses its stderr, and there is one
    authority for "what is a fence".** The DOC ENROLMENT class re-implemented
    the fence grammar as an ERE with `2>/dev/null` on it; BSD grep rejected
    that ERE outright, so on macOS every document counted 0 fences, the
    population collapsed, and grep's explanation was discarded. The count now
    comes from `tests/test_doc_examples.py --count` — the gate that EXECUTES
    the fences, asked over a documented interface, one grammar instead of two —
    and every remaining population scan runs through a helper that turns any
    diagnostic into a RED quoting it.
  - **Nothing in the gate extracts with `grep -o` any more.** On macOS the
    PATHS per-file scan returned zero matches without failing, so six declared
    rows read "never visited" and the class measured nothing while every other
    class passed. `grep -o` is not in POSIX, and GNU and BSD differ on it with
    `-E`, on patterns that can match empty, and on how it composes with `-n`.
    All 18 extraction sites now use POSIX awk `match()`/`RSTART`/`RLENGTH`
    (grep still finds lines; awk extracts), with two rules the helper
    enforces: no backslash escapes in a pattern (a bracket expression instead,
    since `\(` in a string-to-regex conversion is undefined) and no
    `[[:class:]]` or `\b` (the word boundary is an explicit test in the
    extractor). Every class count is unchanged — NUMBERS 25, PATHS 163,
    FLAGS 32, MAKE TARGETS 26, NAMES 454, DOC ENROLMENT 12. And a scan that
    matches ZERO times for a file with a non-zero declared count is now a RED
    **at the scan**, quoting the command and its exit status, instead of a
    "declared population … was never visited" three hundred lines later.
  - **bash 3.2 scans `<( … )` without honouring comments, and the oracle was
    only ever being asked to PARSE.** The apostrophe in a comment inside the
    PATHS loop's `done < <( { … } )` — "resolves relative to its own file's
    directory" — opened a quote that never closed, so 3.2 reported
    `bad substitution: no closing ')'` at RUNTIME and the whole PATHS class
    silently did not run on macOS. `bash -n` calls that clean; measured, both
    ways: `<( { … # …file's… } )` parses and FAILS TO RUN under 3.2, while
    `$( { … # …file's… } )` is fine in both. The loop now feeds from a temp
    file and the comment lives in ordinary shell text. Fourth apostrophe-class
    bug in this gate, so the rule is the construct and not the character: no
    `<( … )` around a multi-line block that can contain a comment.
    **[99zb] now RUNS the shell gates under the old bash**, not only parses
    them (four gates, rc 0 required, count pinned; ~24 s for the parse sweep
    plus the runs) — rounds 11, 12 and 13 were each diagnosable on the dev box
    the moment anybody executed the gate under the oracle instead of parsing it.
  - **The gate's own output was nondeterministic under bash 3.2, and one
    selftest row had been reporting it correctly for four rounds.** Under 3.2 a
    `printf … | grep -q` (or `| head -1`, or `| awk '… exit'`) makes the shell's
    `printf` BUILTIN take SIGPIPE when the reader exits first, and 3.2 prints
    `printf: write error: Broken pipe` on stderr where bash 5 says nothing —
    nondeterministically, because it is a race. That is why "both build states
    produce byte-identical output" failed on macOS: the two runs differed by a
    race, not by build state. Every early-exiting reader in the gate is now fed
    by a here-string rather than a pipe. Reproduced and fixed against real GNU
    bash 3.2.0 (three repeat trials, byte-identical, zero diagnostics).
    The three remaining binary-size rows are now platform-aware: on Linux they
    assert the measurement, off Linux they assert the DEFERRAL and that a
    planted wrong number does NOT red. Every row still runs and still counts on
    both platforms — a row that vanishes on a platform makes a pinned count a
    lie.
  - **A failing gate's window can no longer hide the class that failed.** For
    three CI rounds one macOS red showed up only as six "declared population
    PATHS/… was never visited" lines from an audit far below the class, inside
    the runner's 20-line tail, while the class's own work sat above it. Round 8
    fixed "print what the child said"; the bound it chose became the thing
    hiding the cause. The runner now prints the gate's ENTIRE output (bounded
    at 500 lines, and when that bites it keeps the first 250 AND the last 250,
    never a bare tail), the gate prints a **per-class summary LAST** — examined
    count, files recorded, declared rows, and `THE CLASS DID NOT RUN` as its
    own RED when a class recorded nothing — and the PATHS class states its
    inputs before it walks: the document list, `TRACKED_LIST` and `PRODUCED`
    sizes with each build-product route counted separately, and one line per
    document as it is scanned.
  - **The `make -p` classifier reports its two routes separately and no longer
    depends on the database for variables.** macOS runs GNU Make 3.81 against
    4.3 here and the `-p` dump format is a decade apart; when the database
    yields no variable definitions the tool reads the same `^VAR := value`
    assignments from the Makefile instead. Both routes empty is a hard RED
    naming `make --version`.
  - **`tools/child_exit_check.sh` pins its population exactly** instead of
    holding a floor of 60 against 113 sites: its own "population shrunk"
    planted fault had stopped crossing that floor and the selftest said so.
    A floor plus a plant calibrated against it drifts apart every time the
    population grows; `found == declared` cannot.
  - **The gate runs on macOS.** Three GNU-only constructs made it exit 2 before
    doing anything there: `declare -A` (a syntax error in bash 3.2, which macOS
    still ships), `mktemp -d -p DIR TEMPLATE` and `stat -c %d`. Replaced with a
    full `mktemp` path template, newline-delimited sets with a `case`
    membership test, and no device comparison at all — the cross-filesystem
    case is detected by attempting the hard-link copy, which is a behaviour
    test rather than a platform quiz.
  - **The gate's selftest no longer depends on the FILESYSTEM LAYOUT either.**
    Its scratch tree was hard-linked (`cp -al`) into `/tmp`; a hard link cannot
    cross a filesystem, and on a CI runner the workspace and `/tmp` are
    different mounts, so the copy failed, the helper returned early and three
    cases never ran — 13 red CI jobs against a green local ring. The scratch is
    now created beside the repo, a failed hard-link copy falls back to a real
    `cp -a` and says so, both call sites share one helper, and a selftest row
    forces the cross-filesystem path (via `/dev/shm`) and requires the fallback
    to fire and be announced. `EIGS_DOCS_SCRATCH_DIR` runs the whole selftest
    under that shape. The script also resolves its own path before `cd`, so the
    selftest's child invocations work when it is called by a relative path.
  - **`tools/docs_claims_check.sh` no longer depends on BUILD STATE.** It was
    rc 0 from a clean tree and rc 1 inside the release suite: suite section
    [88] builds `src/eigenlsp`, so by [99za] the path existed, the waiver that
    said "absent from a clean tree by design" matched nothing, and the
    unmatched-waiver rule fired. A path is now CLASSIFIED before it is
    checked — `git ls-files` says SOURCE (tracked and present), `make -p` says
    BUILD PRODUCT (a rule produces it; its existence is never consulted),
    neither is red — and the selftest proves the real doc set is green with the
    products absent AND present, with byte-identical output. Both classifier
    sets are derived from tools, not typed. The selftest also reports cases RUN
    and cases FAILED as two numbers, so a failing case can no longer read as a
    deleted one.
  - The gates were hardened against their own blind spots after a blind
    critic executed every check: a class population can no longer SHRINK
    silently (every class carries a declared per-file count, found ==
    declared both ways, and a waiver that matches nothing is red); the
    suite-size claim is the 258 DISTINCT section labels rather than the 267
    labelled lines, cross-checked against `tools/suite_label_check.sh`; a
    fragment's free names are resolved statically through `--lint` E003, so a
    name hiding in a dead branch is caught; FLAGS covers every `--flag` token
    (and matches whole tokens, so `--ver` no longer passes as a prefix of
    `--version`); PATHS covers Markdown link targets, resolved against the
    LINKING FILE's directory only (a repo-root fallback had accepted
    `](docs/STDLIB.md)` written inside `docs/BUILTINS.md`); the DOC ENROLMENT
    class pins both directions, so a declared row naming a fence-less document
    is red at the class that declares it; a fragment's failure quotes the
    lint's own `error[E003]` line so the rule is greppable; and a value stated
    in a comment inside an executed example is refused.

- **Early HTTP readiness is honest (#1129):** `http_early_bind` now returns
  503 with `Retry-After: 1` during initialization for arbitrary methods/paths.
  Use `http_early_bind of [port, "/livez"]` for an explicit GET/HEAD liveness
  200; normal routing takes over at `http_serve`. The old universal 200
  responder is removed; scalar port/null calls remain supported. The init
  responder's in-flight table is the same size as the serving connection cap;
  the listener stays polled at capacity so a newcomer is 503'd immediately
  rather than queued behind stallers, and a client that never completes a
  request line is 503'd at a 1 s deadline. An idle client cannot delay any
  other client's init-window 200/503. A newcomer past the cap is shed with a
  bodyless 503 (Content-Length 0) for every method, including HEAD (#1135).
  Serving-loop global-cap and per-IP 503s are the same bodyless image (they
  also answer before reading the request). Init-window writes are
  non-blocking: a peer that is not reading is closed rather than stalling
  the single responder thread (#1136).

- **`gather` raises `index_range` on an out-of-range index, in every form
  (#973/#1093).** Previously it folded to `0.0` — a per-row vector of indices
  answered `[1, 0]`, a scalar index into a 1-D tensor answered `0`. A zero in a
  Q-value or a log-prob is indistinguishable from a real zero, `gather`'s own
  dual `scatter_add` already raised on exactly that index, and #1093's contract
  is that a buffer is accepted wherever a flat numeric list is — so the answer
  must not depend on the container. The list path moved with the buffer path;
  the raise is unconditional, not `EIGS_STRICT`-gated, because it reports an
  argument that has no answer rather than a documented soft answer. The
  rationale is recorded at the definition in `src/builtins_tensor.c`.

- **A module namespace is a LIVE VIEW of the module env, not a snapshot
  (#1057).** `import M` bound a shallow copy of M's top-level bindings, so
  whether an importer saw live state depended on the value's TYPE: a dict or
  list was shared by reference, a number or string froze at import time and
  went silently stale, and `M.x is v` reached only the copy. Reading a scalar
  module global now answers its current value, and writing one reaches the
  module. Nine stdlib modules were in the affected shape. `type of M` is still
  `"dict"`, `keys`/`values`/`len`/`str`/`json_encode` are unchanged, and
  `_`-prefixed module bindings stay private. `sizeof(Value)` is unchanged at
  72 bytes: the flag rides existing tail padding and the owning `Env*` lives in
  a side table. `lib/eigen.eigs` mirrors the rule and is asserted against the C
  evaluator in `tests/test_meta_parity.eigs` (read, write, `_`-privacy, and the
  rebinding case — a namespace is the view of the module the IMPORT produced,
  not of the name). Reaching those rows required fixing the meta-interpreter's
  `import`, which read `lib/NAME.eigs` with `read_text` — working-directory
  relative, and answering `""` for an absent path (`read_text`'s documented
  answer), so an unresolved import produced a silently EMPTY namespace instead
  of an error. It now resolves the way the runtime's resolver does — cwd, then
  the stdlib root beside the binary — decides with `file_exists`, and raises
  when nothing resolves.

### Added

- **Consumer-acceptance harness (#1213, #1214, #1217).** `run` takes a
  candidate set (`--full` / `--gfx`); a name a consumer invokes that the
  set does not cover is `UNRUNNABLE|prereq:variant:<name>` with a 127-shim
  on PATH. Variant discovery scans every text file (`grep -rIl`), admits
  multi-hyphen names, and binds `local` before deriving so `run` consults
  the set (a name in a called script is `UNRUNNABLE`, not a 127 FAIL).
  Non-PASS rows keep the last 60 lines of the consumer log in the
  record (`log|<name>|<line>`), or `log|<name>|preflight: <reason>` when
  there is no consumer output; `CA_LOGS` copies logs before cleanup. The
  inventory is a declared 16-name floor plus the last committed record's
  row count (lexically greatest dated filename, never mtime); `run`
  names a floor failure on its own `inventory floor: <why>` line, on
  stdout before the verdict and in the record footer, while the
  `VERDICT:` line itself stays exact. `_extract_runcmd.py`
  matches YAML block-scalar chomping, folding, and relative indent.
  `set -f` around word splits including the variant loop. A signal in
  the pause-before-rename window removes the rewrite temp. `--self-test`
  is a `gate self-tests` CI step; the fixture `plan` step asserts
  `expected=N` with N>0. A uid-0 self-test drops to an unprivileged user
  for `stale-unwritable` or SKIPs that plant by name.

- **Consumer-acceptance `run` residuals (M1 round 7).** Self-test TMPDIR is
  private (concurrent self-tests no longer `rm -rf` each other's
  `ca-run.*`). The consumer process group is reaped after `wait` and the
  per-row call log is a new inode. Export lines are joined with a real
  newline. The call log lives under a directory the consumer is never
  told about. Overlay dirs are copied with `cp -rL`. A gfx bind probe
  must exit 0 with the expected output (`candidate_gfx: unknown` on
  nonzero; gfx prereq treats unknown as missing). `EIGENSCRIPT_GFX` is
  exported only when `CAND_HAS_GFX=1`; `consumer_skips` counts `^SKIP`
  lines and a PASS with skips is `PASS|skips=N`. A bare candidate is
  refused when `$ECO/EigenScript` exists. Plants D/D2 require exactly
  one stdout `VERDICT: INCOMPLETE`. Plant Z's stub lists `gfx_open` and
  its transverse guts the probe-routing/re-arm, not the counter.
  `sibling_binary_present` is computed after the wave too (executable
  regular file only).

- **Consumer-acceptance `run` mode** (`tools/consumer_acceptance.sh run
  <CANDIDATE>`): executes every gated consumer's own acceptance command
  serially against a release candidate, with the candidate on `PATH` as
  `eigenscript`, and writes a record (inventory, examined, per-consumer
  PASS/FAIL/HANG/KILLED/UNRUNNABLE/SKIP, rc, duration, candidate identity).
  `examined == inventory > 0` is required to pass; a missing checkout or
  missing command is UNRUNNABLE not a skip; rc 124/137 is HANG/KILLED by
  name; an interrupted run (INT/TERM/HUP) marks the record INCOMPLETE and
  exits 2. Record class: at every moment the file at `CA_RECORD` is this
  run's record in a truthful state, or absent — never a previous run's
  PASS, never a foreign PASS. Exclusive ownership: a mkdir lock on
  `<record>.lock.d` is taken before invalidate and held through cleanup;
  a second invocation on the same `CA_RECORD` refuses immediately (exit
  2, touches nothing); a stale lock (holder pid dead) is reclaimed with
  a note in the header. Every append is ownership-checked (`run_id=` must
  match this run). `die_record` leaves `RECORD_FINISHED=0` when its FAIL
  footer did not land, so `finish_incomplete` still appends INCOMPLETE or
  clobbers a foreign file in place. The first actions of `run` (before
  the inventory scan, the shim, and the candidate) are: install
  INT/TERM/HUP traps, take the record lock, create the scratch dir,
  invalidate the previous record (move aside, or truncate in place and
  FAIL if the directory will not allow a stash), write the INCOMPLETE
  header (`inventory=PENDING` until the scan finishes). Every record
  write goes through one helper that is checked at every call site.
  `RECORD_FINISHED` is set before the final rename, so a signal after
  the rename is a completed run; the trap still emits exactly one
  stdout `VERDICT:` line on that path. Footer rewrite temps live under
  the run scratch dir. The default record path does not stash an empty
  `.prev`. The footer writer asserts exactly one `VERDICT:` line.
  `CA_TIMEOUT` must be a positive integer (`0`/`00`/`abc` exit 2). Block
  bodies run under `bash -e -o pipefail -c`. Scratch dirs are removed on
  every exit path. `--version` runs under the same per-command timeout.
  The self-test plants a broken candidate, a shrinkage, a hang, an
  interruption, a hanging `--version` probe over a stale PASS, an
  unwritable record path, a two-line block whose first line fails, an
  INT in the pre-scan window, a stale PASS in an unwritable directory, a
  signal during finalization, `CA_TIMEOUT=0`/`00`, a `false | true` block,
  leftover scratch, a second invocation on a live record, a foreign-file
  append, a failed FAIL footer, HUP-after-rename stdout, an unexercised
  row (`true` never calls the candidate), a tree consumer
  (`$EIGS_DIR/src/eigenscript`), a DECLARED command whose file does not
  exist, and a missing environment prereq — each must FIRE — plus an
  honest two-consumer PASS control. A mutant that emits no
  `VERDICT: PASS` is BROKEN-MUTANT, not SILENT. Guards are
  mutation-tested in isolation: each plant is SILENT with its guard
  gutted. Isolation: `CA_ECO` points the inventory at a fixture; the
  self-test never mutates a sibling repo (mechanical-gates §168). Every
  run row carries `cand_calls=N cand_ok=N cand_fail=M` from a counting
  `eigenscript` shim whose log path is baked into the wrapper (not
  exported; not named `CA_*`). `cand_calls` counts only non-trivial
  invocations (a `.eigs` path or a non-flag positional); `--version` /
  `--api` / `--help` / bare are `probe` and do not count. `cand_calls=0`
  cannot be PASS (`UNEXERCISED`). Command rc 0 with `cand_ok=0
  cand_fail>0` is `SWALLOWED`. The consumer inherits
  `EIGS`/`EIGENSCRIPT`/`EIGS_DIR`/`EIGENSCRIPT_DIR`/`EIGENSCRIPT_BIN`/
  `EIGENSCRIPT_GFX` and the shim `PATH`; every `CA_*` name is unset.
  `EIGS_DIR` is a COPY overlay (`src/`, `lib/`, top-level files including
  dotfiles a build may read; never `.git`; `src/eigenscript` is the
  shim). `sibling_binary_present=yes/no` records whether
  `$ECO/EigenScript/src/eigenscript` exists and differs from the
  candidate (DMG#73 is visible, not worked around). DECLARED commands
  are verified at plan time (every `bash`/`python3` file token, plus
  `python3 -m unittest discover -s DIR`); EigenGauntlet is
  `bash tests/run_smoke.sh` and EigenMiniSat is the consumer's real CI
  command including the unittest step. A missing `PREREQS` tool (eddy:
  `go` `java`; EigenMiniSat: `drat-trim`; dynamics: `gfx`, detected via
  `--api` plus a `gfx_open` bind probe) is `UNRUNNABLE|prereq:<tool>`.
  Residuals stated in the record header: a same-uid consumer that reads
  the shim can still find the log path (non-accidental, not
  adversary-proof); a missing tool referenced only inside a called
  script still shows as a generic FAIL; ouroboros `aot/build.sh` keys
  `libeigsrt.a` on `pwd -P` of `$EIGS_DIR/src`, so every run rebuilds
  against the overlay path and leaves `aot/build/.libsrc` stamped with
  a dead path.

- **CI runs each gate where it is suited: a ≤ 15-minute PR lane, the full
  matrix on `main`, and a nightly (#1160).** Measured on PR #1158: 35 min
  wall, ~200 machine-minutes, 26 checks — because the same ~263-section suite
  ran in TEN jobs differing only in the extension surface of the binary, and
  section [99i] (the `-Werror` compile-line audit; ~6 min of audit plus ~11 min
  of self-test on the dev box) ran inside every one of them for a property
  that cannot depend on the variant.
  - `tools/section_plan.sh` derives, per variant, the sections that variant's
    binary actually unlocks. Nothing is hand-listed: it splits
    `tests/run_all_tests.sh` into top-level chunks by asking `bash -n` where a
    statement ends (and verifies the chunks partition the file byte-for-byte),
    reads the `# EIGS-CAP-GATE: <capability>` marker each gate now declares,
    and RUNS that capability's probe — the suite's own probe program — against
    the binary under test. The marker population is pinned against an
    independent over-broad grep across the runner AND every child script the
    runner dispatches, so a capability gate spelled a new way is a hard
    failure rather than a section that silently leaves every plan. `EIGS_SUITE_SECTIONS=<variant> bash
    tests/run_all_tests.sh` runs the derived plan; `bash
    tests/run_all_tests.sh --print-section-plan <variant>` prints it with its
    counts and floors. Measured locally: the `http` plan is 16 sections / 862
    checks in 2m09 against 35m25 for the full suite.
  - Every plan prints `sections=<n> (of <total>) plan=<variant>`, counting the
    headers that will actually EXECUTE, and the runner then counts the headers
    the run printed and fails if the two disagree. A plan of zero sections, a
    RUN of zero assertions, an unparsable probe idiom, a lost marker, a
    core-smoke entry that matches nothing, an unaccounted gate spelling, an
    unused waiver, and a variant whose binary presents fewer capabilities than
    its floor are all hard failures. A `make http` with
    `http_route` unregistered used to print `HTTP tests SKIPPED` and exit 0;
    it now goes red.
  - [99i] is split: its generated-LSP-header probes (`--headers-only`, 0.5 s)
    run UNCACHED on every CI run because the generators read C sources, and
    only the expensive dry-run audit (`--no-headers`) is cached, keyed on
    `tools/werror_cache_key.sh` (the `Makefile`'s content, every tracked
    `*.sh`, and the names of tracked files under `src/ tests/ tools/ web/
    fuzz/`). A local run with no flag still does both halves. The suite jobs set `EIGS_SKIP_WERROR_AUDIT=1`, and [99i] then
    prints a `SKIP:` naming the owning job; unset — every local run — it runs
    in full.
  - **The ASan suite runs in 3 weight-balanced shards. Measured end state:
    13.4 min wall, 30 checks green (run 35020270020) — 35 → 21.1 → 13.4.** The
    first real PR run of this change measured 21.1 min wall with the ENTIRE
    critical path in one job — `asan + ubsan / core and LSP`, 19.0 min
    (4.7 build + 13.9 suite).
    That job stays full (it is the leak-tally gate), so it is parallelised: a
    shard is a subset of the chunk list, split by MEASURED per-section wall
    time (`tests/section_weights.txt`, regenerated with
    `tools/section_plan.sh --print-weights <suite log>` from the runner's new
    `SECTION_TIME:` lines) with a deterministic longest-processing-time greedy,
    so the split never depends on runner timing. The table is measured ON THE
    CI RUNNER: a dev-box table did not transfer (per-section ratios reach 35x
    in both directions), and `--print-weights` reads a raw `gh api …/logs`
    job log directly, timestamp prefix and all. One section now sets the
    floor — `[137]` is 319 s of the 862 s sharded total, and a section cannot
    be split, so no N puts the slowest shard below it. `--shards N --check` pins the
    union to the whole chunk list and the shards to pairwise disjoint, and the
    aggregator `asan + ubsan (full suite)` — unchanged name, still the only
    ruleset-required check — requires every leg green, re-runs that check,
    requires one receipt per shard carrying its plan line, and SUMS the
    LeakSanitizer tallies to 0. The two job-level ASan checks that are not
    sections have DERIVED owners: the collector-traversal check goes to the
    lightest shard, and the LSP behaviour test to whichever shard runs section
    [88] — that shard has already built `eigenlsp` under ASan, which is the
    difference between 1.5 s and 267 s for the same step. Each receipt records
    which extras its shard claimed and the aggregator requires exactly one
    claimant for each. The runner also refuses a malformed `EIGS_SUITE_SHARD`:
    a bare `1` used to parse as k=1,n=1, so a job still named "shard 1/3" ran
    the whole suite while every check stayed green.
  - `macos-15-intel` (35 min, the job that set the PR wall clock) and a
    full-corpus valgrind run move to `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`, which
    opens — or reopens and appends to — one tracking issue on failure.
    `macos-15-intel` also still runs on every push to `main`; the FULL valgrind
    corpus runs nightly only (the PR lane and `main` both run the fixed
    smoke).
  - `docs/CI.md` is the new map: what runs on your PR, what runs on main, what
    runs nightly, and the required-status-check list.

- **`http_response_header of [name, value]` (#1128, #1134):** register up to 16
  validated response headers before serving, including across early bind.
  Every response carries them, including static/file routes, startup,
  OPTIONS and both load-shed 503s (global connection cap and per-IP cap);
  repeated names replace case-insensitively. Invalid names/values and
  runtime-owned framing headers raise and prevent startup. Deterministic
  configuration adds no tape records.

- **`unobserved:` keeps the value window complete (#1049).** An elided
  assignment was absent from the observer's 10-deep value window, so every
  value-channel verdict differed from the unelided program until the missing
  sample aged out. Elision now suppresses the verdict, not the sample.

- **Configurable observer window depth and a scale-free relative step
  (#1044, #1045).** Both were found by phugoid grading verdicts against a
  physical oracle: a fixed 10-deep window called an oscillation `stable`, and
  the same trajectory in radians, degrees and milliradians produced three
  different verdicts. The window depth is settable per state and per binding,
  and the value channel has a characteristic scale.

- **The trace tape carries the observer configuration (#1044, #1045).** A
  verdict is a function of the assignments AND of the thresholds, window depth
  and scale. The tape carried only the assignments, so a reader rebuilt every
  slot at the compiled-in defaults and printed a verdict the live run never
  gave. `--step`, the DAP server and deterministic replay now agree with the
  recording run.

- **Buffers are accepted wherever a flat numeric list is (#1093).** Every
  tensor builtin taking a flat numeric list now takes a `VAL_BUFFER` in the
  same position and returns a buffer when every tensor operand was one. Nested
  2-D list inputs keep list semantics; a shaped buffer is the buffer form of a
  2-D tensor. `zeros of n` returns a buffer.

- **Reverse-mode autograd on shaped buffers (#973)**, plus `matmul_at`,
  `matmul_bt` and `scatter_add`. Three new core builtins.

- **W024: an observer read on a binding rebound from a container element
  (#1048).** Observer trajectory is keyed to an environment slot, never to a
  Value, so a dict field or list element carries no history and the obvious
  per-entity read judges the round-robin interleave of every element the
  binding visits. `docs/PREDICATES.md` gains "What carries a trajectory" with
  the closure-per-entity recipe, extracted and executed by the test rather than
  copied.

- **Every diagnostic is UTF-8 safe at the chokepoint (#1048).** Sweeping
  identifier length 1..250 against v0.43.0 found three shipped rules already
  emitting invalid UTF-8 on both the `--json` and language-server channels
  (W015 at 74 characters, W023 at 161-162, W018 at 198-199), and any non-ASCII
  byte in a source file or filename made 512 of 1524 shape/length combinations
  undecodable. `eigs_utf8_step` / `eigs_utf8_sanitize` now sit under everything
  that truncates a message; the lexer spells an unexpected byte as `\xNN`; the
  parser's caret line counts characters. Gated by
  `tools/lint_source_byte_sweep.py` with a STRICT decoder — `jq` substitutes
  U+FFFD and reports success, which is how this reached a release.

- **`EIGS_STRICT=1` phases C and D (#971, #1008).** JSON parse failure in
  `json_path` (a malformed document was walked leniently and answered the same
  `""` an absent key does), the enumerated NaN sources, and the `-1`/falsy
  wrong-type launderers. With the flag off every one is byte-identical to
  v0.43.0, proven by `tools/strict_differential.sh` against a build of the
  parent commit: 98 identical-when-off, 0 differing, 0 waived, 122/122
  valid-input rows unchanged in both modes.

- **Gated `task_sched_trace` (#846)** — a pure-reader scheduler decision
  history, so a schedule visualizer or a deterministic simulation tester can
  ask "who ran when" without instrumenting every yield site.

- **Dropdown and combobox open lists render in the overlay pass (#859)**, on
  the `_render_popups` path #565 built for menu-bar pull-downs, and grid's
  row-label gutter is folded into its own rect. Two of the #823 containment
  clip's four registry opt-outs are gone.

### Fixed

- **The string-scaling gate binds the runtime it measures, measures in
  interleaved rounds, and states the scope it actually has (#1188, #1189).** Both found by a blind critic, by
  execution, on the enrolment itself. #1188: the suite section ran the child
  without binding `EIGS`, on the reasoning that the child's default resolves to
  the suite's binary — true, and only a default. Exporting `EIGS` at a healthy
  binary made the SAME section report 2/2 PASS against the **pre-fix quadratic
  tree**. The section now passes the runtime explicitly and then asserts, by
  inode, that the child measured that file: a reasoned default is not a
  binding, and a binding nobody checked is not evidence. #1189: with two CPU
  hogs on a 2-core box the median-of-5 gate returned a worst ratio of **6.51**
  on a healthy binary — a false RED, 1 run in 3, and CI runners are exactly
  that machine.

  The first answer to that — take each point's **minimum** and confirm a red
  with three times the samples — was itself broken by the next critic round,
  and the way it broke is the interesting part: the minimum selects a rare
  fast path, and confirming with MORE samples makes that selection likelier,
  so the confirmation was biased toward green **by construction**. It passed a
  subject that was quadratic on 51 invocations out of 60. A one-sample
  confirmation also cleared every selftest row then present.

  The fix is structural rather than statistical. Each **round** measures every
  length back to back and yields its own doubling ratios, so a stall is
  confined to the round it landed in instead of contaminating a per-length
  aggregate that the ratio then divides; the verdict is the **median** of 15
  round ratios. And there is **no second pass at all** — a re-measurement is a
  second chance for any subject whose badness is intermittent, and three of
  the critic's subjects walked through exactly that door. Measured: 0 false
  reds in 14 runs under two CPU hogs (readings 1.80–2.06), the pre-fix binary
  red at 4.57, and a runtime that is quadratic on four invocations in five
  still red.

  **Both execution tiers are measured (#1200).** The probe forced
  `EIGS_JIT_OFF=1` -- added to sanitise the environment, and it narrowed the
  gate to the interpreter. A blind critic replaced `val_str_len(target)` with
  `strlen(target->data.str)` in `jit_helper_index_get` alone -- a real
  one-line regression in `src/jit.c`, no harness edit -- and the gate stayed
  GREEN at 2.02 while JIT'd scans grew 5.18x and 3.82x per doubling. The gate
  now runs its round structure once per tier, reports each, takes the worse,
  and names the tier that moved: the same binary reads 5.31 and fails, and
  the pre-#1185 binary now fails on both (4.41 interpreter, 4.65 JIT). Its
  own knobs are validated too (#1202): `ROUND_RATIO_Q=2` indexed past the
  sorted ratios and reported `0.00 PASS` against a quadratic runtime, so an
  out-of-range knob is now an instrument failure rather than a measurement.

  A fifth round found the gate's coverage claim was **false**: the header said
  it exercised `len of`, and the probe hoisted that call out of the timed
  loop. A critic reverted one line — `builtin_len`'s `val_str_len(arg)` back
  to `strlen(...)`, half of the #1183 regression — and the gate stayed GREEN
  at 2.01. Putting the call back in the loop does catch it (3.68 against 2.06
  healthy) and **was tried and reverted**: `EIGS_STR_LEN_CHECK` makes `len of`
  O(n) by design in the asan/valgrind/poison builds, which then read 2.56–2.98
  under load against the 2.90 threshold — 2 false reds in 5 — while the lowest
  unhealthy reading is 3.36. No threshold separates those. The coverage and
  the sanitizer lanes cannot both be had from one gate, so the header now
  states the real scope (indexing, exactly one operation) and the gap is filed
  as #1192 with the measurements and three ways to close it.

  **The threshold is now placed from measured spreads rather than taste**, at
  2.90: release readings 1.80–2.06, asan 2.35–2.50 under load, the pre-fix
  binary 4.27–4.64. `EIGS_STR_LEN_CHECK` (asan, valgrind, poison) re-derives
  every cached length with `strlen(3)` at every read — the O(n) index #1183
  removed — so those builds genuinely read higher, and a third critic round
  killed the attempt to exclude them: the probe grepped the binary for the
  diagnostic string the check prints, and relinking the ordinary release
  objects with that string in a non-allocated `.ident` section (`.text`
  byte-for-byte identical) made the gate skip a perfectly good release binary
  and report SKIPPED. Content presence is not evidence of compiled behaviour,
  and a gate that can be talked into skipping is worse than one that is mildly
  pessimistic. Every build is measured; the release lane stays the authority.
  Selftest 11 -> 23 cases, two of which pin the threshold from below (an
  n^1.58 shape must be rejected) so it cannot drift upward unnoticed.

- **The docs-claims gate no longer reads its own stdin, and the guard that
  depended on it can fire (#1186).** Five counters were spelled
  `x=$(grep -c .) <<< "$LIST"` — the here-string lands on the ASSIGNMENT, and a
  command substitution is expanded before any redirection is applied, so the
  `grep` read the SCRIPT's stdin instead of the list. Two silent faces: with
  stdin at `/dev/null` the count was 0, and the §121 guard built on it compared
  `0 -ne 0` and passed, so **it had never been able to fire**; with stdin an
  open stream (a background job, a pipeline) the same line BLOCKED — measured
  at 20 minutes of silence, taking `tools/portability_parse_check.sh`, which
  runs this gate under bash 3.2, down with it. The sites now take their input
  inside the substitution; `exec 0</dev/null` at the top of the gate closes the
  CLASS, so no future spelling can hang and degrades to the zero instead; and
  that zero is now red (`the fence counter was handed ZERO documents`). Two new
  `--selftest` rows pin both faces — the plant restores the bug and must go
  red, and the mechanism row proves the `exec` line is load-bearing.

- **A string Value carries its length, so indexing is O(1) and a character
  scan is O(n) (#1183).** `struct Value`'s `VAL_STR` payload was a bare
  `char *` with no length while every other sequence in the same union caches
  one (`list.count`, `buffer.count`, `text_builder.len`), so every `s[i]`
  bounds-check, every `len of`, every slice and every concat called `strlen(3)`
  over the whole string — a character scan was quadratic. Measured before:
  20k chars 27.2 ms, 40k 118.9, 80k 412.0, 160k 1538.8 (~4x per doubling);
  after: 9.3 / 19.0 / 35.9 / 71.6 ms (~2x per doubling, 21.5x faster at 160k).
  ouroboros self-compiling its own 2460-line front end — a LEXER, which scans
  source text character by character — went 2.56s -> 1.62s (n=5 medians,
  interleaved), and its 63-program parity oracle plus the byte-exact bootstrap
  fixed point still pass. No observable behaviour changed and `struct Value`
  did not grow: the length lives in the union beside the pointer. The payload
  member is now `char *const`, so `v->data.str = p` does not COMPILE and every
  construction site must go through `val_str_set()`; `EIGS_STR_LEN_CHECK` (on
  in every asan/poison/valgrind build, so the whole suite runs under it)
  re-derives the length at every read and aborts on a mismatch. Gated by
  `tests/test_string_scaling.sh`, a doubling-RATIO gate (worst ratio 4.69
  before, 2.00 after, max 2.90) — a ratio and not a wall-clock budget, so the
  claim is about the algorithm and not about the machine. The suite runs it as
  section **[99zc]** along with its 23-case selftest, most of whose cases
  are ways a blind critic made the gate report PASS on the still-quadratic
  binary; `tools/portability_parse_check.sh` runs that selftest under bash 3.2.

- **A stale STORE handle is refused, not silently emptied (#1146, round 2).**
  The generation check landed with the rest of #1146 and correctly CAUGHT a
  store handle whose slot had been recycled — and `builtin_store_get` then
  turned the failed resolve into `make_null()` with no error. So the ABA moved
  from "silently returns the FRESH store's record" to "silently returns null",
  both at exit status 0, which is the same class one builtin short of closed.
  Found by a blind critic, by execution. All nine store builtins now resolve
  through one raising wrapper, so a tenth cannot re-open the hole by forgetting
  to check. A channel handle with a forged or stripped `_channel_gen` is
  likewise refused by `send`/`recv`/`try_recv`/`recv_timeout`/`close_channel`
  (`channel_closed` keeps its documented ANSWER of 1 for an unknown channel,
  #971 Phase D) — a second critic's own mutant, which ignored the generation
  for channels only, survived the round-1 oracle 10/10 because no live row ever
  presented one. Gated by `handles_store_stale` and `handles_channel_stale` in
  `tests/test_handles_mt.sh` and by both mutants in the train.

- **Two concurrent joins of one thread handle no longer hang the process
  (#1146).** `thread_join` looked the handle up under the handle mutex and
  then called `pthread_join` outside it, leaving the slot claimable, so two
  joiners both passed the lookup and both joined one thread id — undefined
  behaviour under POSIX, and on glibc the second caller never wakes. The probe
  hung 7/7 runs across two reviewers and 3/3 on the maintainer box; the loser
  then read the freed handle, and ThreadSanitizer refused the program outright
  (`CHECK failed: sanitizer_thread_registry.cpp:348`). The claim step makes the
  resolve-and-detach atomic, so exactly one caller reaches `pthread_join`.
  After the fix the same probe completes in 0.12 s, 20/20 runs, TSan-clean.
  Two more silent failures went with it: a stale handle after 255 spawn/join
  cycles joined a DIFFERENT thread (returning `"FRESH"` for the stale handle
  and `null` for the fresh one, at exit status 0) and now raises; and 300
  unjoined spawns against the 255-slot table reported
  `spawned=255 raises=0 silent=45` at exit status 0 and now raise 45 catchable
  `limit` errors. Gated by `tests/test_handles_mt.sh` (suite [42l]), rows in
  `tests/test_tsan.sh`, and the mutation train `tools/handles_mt_mutants.sh`.

- **The module-env lock now covers module namespaces (#1161).** `#607`'s
  "shared env under MT" predicate was `multithreaded && parent == NULL`. Every
  sealed ROOT env satisfies it; no imported module's namespace env does,
  because a namespace is `env_new(g_global_env)` and has a parent — so the lock
  never engaged for exactly the envs that `M.field is v` writes. Two workers
  each adding 2,000 distinct new fields to one imported module grew its
  `names[]`/`slots[]` with no lock: the release binary crashed 5/5
  (`double free or corruption`, `realloc(): invalid next size`, SIGSEGV) and
  ThreadSanitizer reported 61 findings (57 data races, 4 heap-use-after-free)
  before dying inside `strcmp`. The predicate is now a property the env
  carries (`Env::mt_shared`), set in exactly two places — a root env at
  creation, a module namespace at attach — so every MT-only env guard reads
  one definition of "shared". The namespace's dict MIRROR is serialized on the
  same mutex, because a module namespace is two structures and locking one of
  them is not locking the namespace. The same repro is now TSan-clean and
  answers `keys=4002` 10/10. Single-threaded cost is unchanged: 5,000,000
  `M.field is v` writes, n=5 interleaved against the pre-fix binary, 1.1865 s
  -> 1.1829 s median (-0.3%, inside the spread), `instructions:u` +1.7%.

- **`load_file` / `import` work from a spawned worker (#1144).** `import` is an
  ordinary statement, so it is legal inside a `define` body and therefore
  inside a worker — but the loader had no thread story and four of its
  structures were shared and unguarded. On the release binary two workers
  loading the same module exited 1 with `load_file: circular dependency —
  '...' is already being loaded` **with no cycle present** (and SIGSEGV on
  some runs); under ThreadSanitizer the same program reported 17-24 warnings.
  Four fixes, one per structure: the `#496` in-flight load stack moved from
  the state to the **thread** (a cycle is re-entrancy on one C stack, so the
  thread is the exact scope, and a real cycle is still reported — on the main
  thread and inside a worker); the module cache took a per-state mutex; the
  process-global module-namespace table became an immutable-shape snapshot
  published through one atomic pointer, with tombstoned removals and retired
  (not freed) replaced tables, so the `M.field` **read path takes no lock in
  either mode**; and `vm_execute`'s slot-promotion guard reads the shared
  module env's `count` — and grows it — under the existing `#607` lock.
  A fifth fix is the `#1141` rule applied to the loader's write path:
  `env_set_local_pre_interned_slot` stored the name the WRITING thread had
  interned straight into the shared root env, so after that worker detached
  the next lookup `strcmp`'d freed bytes (ASan: heap-use-after-free in
  `strcmp` <- `env_hash_find`, freed in `env_intern_table_unref`) and the
  release binary intermittently answered `undefined variable` for a function
  it had just defined. Contract and residuals: docs/CONCURRENCY.md, "Loading
  from workers" (the same-binding write race stays out of scope as #1171). Gated by `tests/test_loader_mt.sh` (15 live + 6 selftest
  checks, suite [42j]), the loader rows in `tests/test_tsan.sh`, and
  `tools/loader_mt_mutants.sh`.

- **Concurrent `import` of the same module yields ONE module, not two
  (#1144).** A consequence of making the loader thread-safe at all, and found
  by executing the new contract: two threads could both get past the module
  cache probe and both build a private dict and env, and the one that lost the
  race to store it dropped the store and pushed **its own** instance anyway.
  That is a silent split brain — `M.x is v` through the loser's handle landed
  in an instance nothing else could reach, and a reader that lost the race
  never observed the writer's state. Measured on the fixed-loader branch
  before this change, two workers importing one slow module (writer sets 41,
  reader reads after a spin): `writer=41 reader=7 main=41`,
  `writer=41 reader=7 main=7`, ... the reader **never** saw 41 in six runs,
  and `main` read the stale value in two of them. On v0.43.0 the same program
  had failed loudly instead (a false "circular dependency"), so the loader fix
  had converted a loud failure into a quiet one. `eigs_module_cache_put` now
  reports whether it stored the entry and the loser adopts the winner's
  instance. What is **not** deduplicated is the module's top-level BODY: both
  threads are already executing it when the race is decided, so module-scope
  side effects can repeat (a module-level `print` printed twice in 2 of 3
  runs) — only the bindings are single. Both facts are stated, with a
  byte-checked example, in docs/CONCURRENCY.md. Gated by the
  `loader_mt_same_import` suite row (release AND ThreadSanitizer) and the
  `lost-put-pushes-private` mutant.

- **The observer arming sets are safe under concurrency (#1145).** Both
  compile-time arming tiers — the history tier (`prev of x`) and the
  occurrence tier (`<kw> is x when <n>`) — are process-global arrays that grew
  by `realloc` with nothing guarding them. Two shapes broke them and they need
  different predicates, so the guard is now one leaf mutex taken
  **unconditionally**: (a) one state with `spawn`, where a worker compiling
  `what is q when 1` reallocs `g_occ_names` while other workers' assignments
  walk it — `spawn` widens only the history tier (#827) and the occurrence
  tier deliberately has no wildcard (#868); and (b) **two embed states with no
  `spawn`**, where `multithreaded` is a per-state flag that is 0 on both
  threads, which is how `src/ext_http.c` runs (a fresh state per connection)
  — 25 ThreadSanitizer reports including a heap-use-after-free in
  `arm_set_has`. The occurrence tier's lazily-memoised window
  (`trace_occ_window`) is now published atomically for the same reason. Cost
  is nil on any hot path: an assignment consults an arming set once per name
  per arming generation, not once per assignment. Gated by
  `tests/test_arming_mt.sh` (9 live + 5 selftest checks, suite [42k]),
  `tests/test_arming_two_states.c` under both the release/ASan lane and
  ThreadSanitizer, and `tools/arming_mt_mutants.sh`.

- **A dict key written by a worker outlives the worker (#1141).** Key strings
  are interned, and `dict_set_hashed_raw` interned them into the WRITING
  THREAD's table — which `eigs_thread_detach` frees. A dict shared by
  reference is the parent's and outlives the worker, so `d.added_by_worker is
  42` inside a spawned closure left the parent holding freed key pointers:
  `keys of d` printed garbage bytes and every new field read back `null`, at
  exit code 0, with no race anywhere (spawn → join → read is serialized).
  Under TSan it was a heap-use-after-free in `make_str` ← `builtin_keys`
  against a free in `env_intern_table_unref` ← `eigs_thread_detach`. #293
  already re-homed keys for values crossing a channel or a join result; an
  in-place write through a shared reference crosses no boundary and so got
  nothing. Now, while the process is multithreaded, a key is interned at
  INSERTION into the process-global, mutex-guarded table #293 introduced, so
  its lifetime is the process rather than the writing thread. The gate is
  `g_vm_multithreaded`, exactly like the refcount-atomics gate: a program
  that never spawns takes the single-threaded path it always took, and pays
  one predicted-false test on the insert path only. Covers a dict written in
  place, a worker-built dict published through a shared list, nested dicts,
  and a read long after the worker was joined and its handle released.
  VALUES remain the user's race to avoid (#1152). Residual: entries in the
  process-global table are never reclaimed, so a long-running multithreaded
  program whose workers write an unbounded number of DISTINCT keys retains
  them for the process lifetime — bounded by distinct key strings, not by
  writes or by dicts. Gated by `tests/test_dict_keys_mt.sh` (suite [42i]),
  the TSan arm in `tests/test_tsan.sh`, and the mutation train
  `tools/dict_keys_mutants.sh`.

- **The trace tape is safe under threads and states (#1142, #1143).** A
  process-wide mutex is held for each whole record and each replay take, so
  concurrent `spawn` workers and co-located `EigsState`s no longer tear
  lines, overflow the embed sink, or mix taped and live values. Replay of a
  nondet builtin on a non-main thread raises the same catchable error as
  `recv` (per-thread N streams are not this round). `O cfg` diffs against
  what that state last emitted. `eigs_close` shuts the process tape only
  when it closes the last live state, and deciding that is the same atomic
  step as decrementing the live-state count, so two states closing at once
  cannot both leave the tape open with zero states; `eigs_trace_shutdown`
  is the process owner's explicit teardown. The arm/occurrence wildcard and
  generation, which the recorder consults before it takes the tape lock,
  are ACQUIRE/RELEASE rather than plain ints. Single-threaded tapes stay
  byte-identical **and faster**: records are formatted into one output
  buffer under the mutex and committed as one sink call per record and one
  `fwrite` per ~32 KiB, replacing a per-byte `fputc`, so a 613,506-record
  single-threaded tape runs 3.4% faster than before the mutex existed
  (n=5 interleaved, CPU-time medians). The embed sink now receives ONE
  complete record per call at any record length, **and at any record
  COUNT**: an emit window that stages a scope transition (`S`) or an
  `O cfg` diff in front of its `A`/`N` record is split at every newline
  under the lock, so a consumer that maps one call to one journal entry
  (the EigenOS M11 shape the header describes) no longer drops the
  records that ride along. The byte stream is unchanged. The 4096-byte
  per-byte sink line buffer that the two-state probe overflowed is gone.
  Two of the new invariants are gated STRUCTURALLY, because their windows
  are a few instructions wide and unobservable from a harness: the close
  decision reads no live-state count (`close-count-toctou` in
  `tests/test_trace_mt.sh`), and the sink callback fires under the tape
  mutex, proved by a bounded rendezvous inside the callback in
  `src/embed_concurrent.c` rather than by hoping a schedule tears.
  The tape's new `pthread_self`/`pthread_once` imports are enrolled in the
  freestanding ledger (`tools/freestanding_allowlist.txt`,
  `tools/freestanding_hal_roots.txt`, docs/FREESTANDING.md) — thread
  IDENTITY is a kernel-owed HAL root on EigenOS, not portable C, and
  `make freestanding-check` was red without them.
  Two more invariants joined the structural set rather than resting on a
  schedule: `eigs_replay_take` runs under the tape mutex, proved by an
  emitter's sink callback holding a bounded window while the other thread
  attempts a take (a take that COMPLETES inside the window is an overlap —
  0 of 80 here, 80 of 80 unlocked), which retires a ThreadSanitizer kill
  that was measured surviving 1 train run in 10; and `trace_set_sink`
  commits the `V` header in the same critical section that publishes the
  callback, so the first call a freshly installed sink receives is always
  its own header even while a sibling state records (0 of 24 here, 24 of 24
  with the header emitted after the unlock). **A sink-only tape's memory is
  bounded by the largest RECORD, not by the tape** — the staging buffer
  rewinds after every hand-off — which is what makes the sink usable as
  EigenOS M11's journal; that one line had no witness and now has one
  (`trace_out_capacity()`, unchanged at 64 KiB across 12 MB of sink bytes
  against 16 MB without the rewind). It follows, and is measured, that an
  embedder has no buffered tail: a host that exits without `eigs_close` or
  `eigs_trace_shutdown` loses nothing. The `atexit(trace_shutdown)` comment
  in `trace_init` said that registration also covered "an embedder that
  leaks its state"; it does not — `trace_init` has one caller in the tree,
  `src/main.c` — and now says so. The mutation train is fourteen mutants,
  each killed 10/10, and no longer needs a ThreadSanitizer build.

- Standard-library imports and `exe_path` retain an absolute executable
  anchor after `chdir` on macOS, including relative and PATH launches (#1133).
- Matrix products use separate binary64 multiplication and addition across
  platforms, preserving strict-mode invalid-result detection (#1131).
- CI completes extension and sanitizer variants in separate workers. macOS
  harnesses handle filename rejection, use an LLVM leak-detection runtime,
  and reject sanitizer startup failures (#1126).

- **`EIGS_STRICT=1` reaches the graphics and audio extension (#1007).**
  `src/ext_gfx.c` had no raise path at all — `grep -c rt_error src/ext_gfx.c`
  was 0 — while ~89 argument reads went straight through `items[N]->data.num`,
  and `Value`'s union overlaps `double num` with `char *str`, so a string
  where a number belonged reinterpreted a pointer as a double. `gfx_rect of
  [10, 10, 50, 50, "255", 0, 0]` drew a BLACK rectangle where red was asked
  for, and ~52 `make_null()` returns stood in for a rejected argument,
  indistinguishable from the same builtin's ordinary "nothing to do" answer.
  60 `ARG_GUARD`/`STRICT_REQUIRE` sites now cover the drawing calls, the text
  calls, `gfx_fb`, `ppu_render_frame`, the generators, the mixer and the three
  device openers; every one sits above the `load_sdl2()` call and above any
  device check, so it is reachable where CI runs, and the two trace-recorded
  builtins (`gfx_read`, `audio_capture_open`) guard above the tape seam so a
  rejected argument neither consumes nor writes a record. The union pun is
  gone in BOTH modes: what a rejected call *draws* changes, every returned
  value stays byte-identical. A guard covers the argument's CONTAINER as well
  as its elements — three rounds of blind review found the same axis three
  times, most sharply in the openers, where `audio_stream_open of [48000]`
  opened the device at the 44100/1 defaults and handed back a real device id,
  telling a caller that asked for 48000 that it got 48000. Four gates carry
  it: `tools/gfx_strict_sweep.sh` (section [139]) derives the guarded names
  and their arity from the file's own `want` strings and crosses them with the
  wrong-container shapes — 35 names, 140 rows, 129 raises, 11 in a
  staleness-checked allowlist; `tools/gfx_pixel_differential.sh` (section
  [138]) is the readback oracle, because every drawing builtin returns null on
  every path and a returned-value differential measures that surface in the
  one state where it cannot fail; `tests/test_asan_gfx.sh` (section [137])
  makes `make asan-gfx` a gate over a six-program corpus, with its own
  positive and negative leak controls — its triage found one leak and it was
  ours (`gfx_poll`'s event dict, 584 bytes on the two decode-nothing paths),
  so no LeakSanitizer suppression ships; and `tools/failsoft_classify_check.sh`
  scopes `return make_null()` into the classified population for this one file
  (`NULL_SCOPE`, floor 136 -> 174, new `fs:VOID` tag). A builtin that takes no
  argument still ignores one and a surplus trailing argument is still dropped;
  both are the general over-arity question (#989) and are stated in
  `docs/BUILTINS.md` rather than left to be discovered.

- **Three `EIGS_STRICT` guards leaked their own allocation on every raise
  (#971 round 2).** `STRICT_REQUIRE` returns, so it has to sit above anything
  the function already owns; in `scan_ints`, `scan_tokens` and
  `scan_int_tokens` it sat one line below a 128-element `make_list`, losing
  1096 bytes per raise. The soft path is unchanged. Nothing caught it because a
  strict raise already exits non-zero, so a leak detector's exit changes
  nothing about the process status and a leaking guard looks exactly like a
  working one — the strict-math test drove these very rows and reported 85 of
  85 passing under the sanitizer. Those rows are now leak-gated by reading the
  sanitizer's own text out of the output the assertion already captures.
- **`tools/werror_switch_check.sh` no longer swaps its script population under
  load (#971 round 2).** It chose between `git ls-files` and a filesystem walk
  by whether the first produced output, so a fork that lost a race for memory
  silently switched to the walk, which enumerates untracked build output and
  scratch directories and reports them as unenrolled scripts. That is the root
  cause of the intermittent `[99i]`/`[99p]` failure where the audit printed its
  own success line and the section failed anyway. The choice is now made by
  whether the process is inside a work tree at all, and an empty listing inside
  one is an error rather than a cue to look elsewhere.
- **`tools/strict_differential.sh` has no divergence-waiver mechanism (#971
  round 2).** `differing-when-off: 0` is the single claim the tool makes, and
  an exemption path is that claim with a hole in it. Both failure modes had
  already been paid for: a waiver outliving its pull request made the
  documented pre-land command fail on a clean tree for a whole release window,
  and a waiver hides exactly what the tool exists to show.

- **`tools/strict_differential.sh` (suite section `[99s]`) no longer flakes red
  on a green tree under load (#1120).** Its verdicts were decided with
  `printf … | grep -q …` under `set -o pipefail`, which is a race rather than a
  test: `grep -q` exits the moment it matches and closes the pipe, the still-
  writing `printf` takes SIGPIPE and exits 141, and pipefail reports the
  pipeline as failed while grep itself reported a match. A probe was therefore
  scored "raised by the wrong guard" while the diagnostic printed beside it
  contained that guard's own message. Measured with the pipe form in place: 18
  red runs in 186 under load, spread over 18 different probes; 0 in 300 without
  it. Every verdict site now matches with the shell itself, no fork and no pipe,
  and a new `--selftest` that `[99s]` runs before the differential pins those
  matchers and reproduces the race deterministically. Alongside it: a
  variant-only presence check that did not run is reported as an unrun probe
  instead of being assumed present and charged to a guard; the tool fingerprints
  its subject binary at both ends, so a `make` that re-points `src/eigenscript`
  mid-run says so instead of looking like a broken guard; signal deaths are
  named rather than left as a number; and any run that finds something writes
  each finding's whole capture, exit status and matched pattern to an evidence
  directory it names, including whether the pattern is in those bytes after
  all — which labels a self-contradicting verdict as a harness bug on sight.

- **`--lint` leaked the parsed `eigs.json` on every run inside a project whose
  manifest has any nested value (#1121).** `"deps": {}` is enough, and it is in
  the manifest every repo in the fleet ships. Dropping a reference to a list or
  dict registers a cycle-collector candidate rather than freeing it, and the
  eight pre-global `--<mode>` returns skipped the exit sweep the run path
  performs. All eight now drain, not just the one that leaked. Found because
  the suite's own `eigs.json` allow-list test had been running the leaking
  shape five times per run since it was written, capturing the linter's text
  and discarding its exit status; `tests/test_lint.sh` now routes sanitizer
  output to a log directory and fails on any diagnostic from any child.

- **The observer write-path gate no longer arms on the mere presence of an
  import or of an observer name in the constant pool (#1046, #915).** Literal
  imports are resolved at compile time and names are matched on `OP_GET_NAME`
  rather than against the whole pool. Both stand-ins cost read-free programs
  their gate.

- **A fresh `for` binder is loop-scoped inside a function too (#1105).** With
  no pre-existing binding it was loop-scoped at module scope but persisted in a
  function, so a post-loop read silently answered the last element.

- **The REPL no longer swallows the line that closed a failed multi-line unit
  (#1109).** An unindented non-blank line is both the terminator of an open
  block and part of the same compiled unit; on a tokenize, parse or compile
  failure the whole buffer was discarded, taking a statement the user typed and
  that never ran.

- **Replay: a boundary refusal on a VM-less worker is a clean exit (#1112).**
  It printed the #148 diagnostic and then died by `SIGSEGV`.
  `tools/replay_diff.sh` now fails on any signal.

- **Embed: `obs_history_gap` is stored at the end of a closed isolated eval
  unit (#1114).** It was stored only at the next eval boundary, so a host
  reading `observer_predicate_at` directly between units was told history was
  complete for exactly one boundary while the answer came from the stale
  window.

- **The meta-interpreter honours the `report`/`report_value` reservation
  (#1111).** `lib/eigen.eigs` still let both be bound and accepted
  non-identifier operands, reproducing the shadowing #1102 removed from the
  runtime.

- **`tools/observer_gate_diff.sh` normalises the executable directory and the
  out-of-tree import-shadow warning before diffing (#1115)**, so two
  byte-identical trees at different paths no longer compare unequal.

### Changed

- **Layering has structure rather than convention (#744, closing #746).** The
  core no longer includes any extension's private header: `src/ext_register.h`
  carries the registrars and per-state teardowns as declarations only, so
  `builtins.c` and `state.c` compile with the database extension enabled on a
  machine with no PostgreSQL headers, which they previously could not.
  `vm.c` no longer re-declares any cross-TU symbol; the stale block-scope
  externs are gone, including one for a symbol that exists nowhere, and the two
  legitimate ones are homed in `vm.h` and `eigenscript.h`. Three new
  translation units carry code moved verbatim: `src/fsutil.c` (file reading and
  the module-resolver chain, so the VM, compiler, formatter, linter and the
  embedding API stop reaching into the builtins layer to read a file),
  `src/task.c` (the cooperative scheduler, with its state now private to it),
  and `src/builtins_buf.c` (numeric buffers, the vectorized kernels, PCM16LE
  and DEFLATE). Behaviour-preserving, proven: a 532-program corpus differential
  against a pre-change build is byte-identical and `tools/jit_diff.sh` is
  clean. A new gate, `tools/core_ext_boundary_check.sh`, keeps the boundary
  from drifting back, with a structural scan anchored to the Makefile's source
  list and an executable probe that poisons the PostgreSQL header so it cannot
  pass vacuously on a machine that has it. Five build-source lists that nothing
  tied to the tree now derive from the Makefile or were corrected; one of them
  had been silently costing the language-server builtin index 19 signature
  comments. Per-layer headers, and breaking up the 1253-line umbrella header,
  are recorded in `ROADMAP.md` as their own round.

- **The observer gate is hoisted ahead of the observe helpers, in both the
  interpreter and the JIT (#972).** With the gate closed, every assignment
  still dispatched into a helper, decoded the top of stack and resolved a slot
  or hashed name, only to return at the helper's own gate test one frame later.

- **The builtin counts in `README.md` and `docs/BUILTINS.md` are derived from
  `eigenscript --api` and gated (#1118).** Both claimed "250+ builtin functions
  (199 core + ~60 extensions)"; the parenthetical was wrong on both terms and a
  hand-maintained count re-drifts on the next addition — the issue measured 253
  core and the tree already read 258 by the time the fix was written. Now 348
  (261 core + 87 extensions), checked by `tools/doc_drift_check.sh`.

- **`ext_net` raw TCP/UDP sockets are ticked as shipped in `ROADMAP.md`
  (#1119).**

## [0.43.0] - 2026-09-06

### Breaking changes

- **`report` and `report_value` are reserved observer forms (#1102): they
  cannot be bound or used as values, and `report of name` / `report_value of name`
  require an identifier operand (parentheses around the identifier are allowed).**
  Every binding position now fails before the source unit runs, with parse
  diagnostic `E005`, including parameters, loops, comprehensions, destructuring,
  catches, and imports. Non-identifier operands also fail with `E005`; assign an
  expression to a variable before reporting its trajectory. Name/slot observer
  behavior is unchanged, and dict keys may still use these words. The shared
  parser enforces the rule for files, REPL units, dynamic loads/eval, and hosts;
  lint and LSP carry the same code. CLI `-e <source> [args...]` now accepts a
  source string through the file execution path.
  The builtin reference table and LSP Function completions omit both forms.
  Two new token kinds (`TOK_REPORT`, `TOK_REPORT_VALUE`) shift the tokenizer's
  identifier vocabulary ids by +2, visible in `tests/test_corpus.eigs` output;
  consumers that key corpora on raw token ids (iLambdaAi) must rebuild them.
  The VM retains the `report` builtin for existing bytecode that resolves
  its name through `vm_run_bytecode`; its value-only behavior is unchanged.

- **File resolution is independent of the process working directory (#1056).**
  `load_file` and `import` search the containing file's directory, the existing
  `eigs_modules` walk, the nearest `eigs.json` project root, then the stdlib
  locations. Absolute paths remain as-is. The bare cwd step and one-parent
  fallback are removed; consumers using root-relative paths from subdirectory
  files need an `eigs.json` at their project root. Nested loads and functions
  retain the containing file's directory. Errors identify the roots tried.
  Imported top-level `for` bodies now retain their plain `is` bindings in the
  module, matching main and load_file; the loop binder remains loop-scoped.
  `tools/road_diff.sh` gates all three roads and proves its own failure paths.

### Added

- **Embed observer contract (#1038/#1028).** States start with recording open,
  so native/assembled hosts need no startup `eigs_obs_enable()` workaround.
  Embed initialization keeps later module compilations from closing recording
  behind a native caller. Compile verdicts still close the CLI gate for read-free programs. The additive
  `eigs_set_eval_observer_isolated` host opt-in allows read-free eval units to
  skip observation; default evals retain cross-unit history. Missing history
  rejects later reader units with `EIGS_OBS_FORCE=1` guidance, conservatively
  even for independent bindings. Escaped compiled functions retain the gate's
  accumulated verdict; registered C callbacks keep eval recording open.
  Explicit host `eigs_obs_enable()` also pins the next isolated eval open,
  so direct host predicates can read that unit's recorded assignments; the
  request is consumed at one eval boundary. A C regression runs under the
  suite's build variant.

- **`is_file of path` (#1058).** 1 iff the path names a REGULAR file
  (`S_ISREG`); 0 for a directory, a device/fifo/socket, a missing path, or a
  non-string. `read_file_util` admits only regular files, and a driver that
  had to match that contract before reading (the self-host and AOT
  compilers) had only `file_exists` (an fopen probe: opens `/dev/null`,
  fifos, directories) and `is_dir` — the non-regular non-directory class
  passed both and read as `""`, so `/dev/null` compiled to the empty program
  at rc 0 where the oracle refuses. Trace-recorded like `is_dir`; the replay
  suite records with the file present, deletes it, and replays the 1.
- **`tools/suite_label_check.sh`, suite section `[99w]` (#1025).** Five
  pairs of distinct suite sections printed the same `[NNx]` label (a sixth
  surfaced while writing the check), so a CI log grepped by section name
  resolved to the wrong block. The check reads every labelled `echo` in the
  runner and fails when a label recurs outside a SKIPPED/stub twin; it also
  fails when it finds fewer than 150 labels (the vacuity case). Planted both
  ways before it was trusted. The six collisions are renamed.
- **`tools/jit_diff.sh` — the JIT's oracle is the interpreter, and now
  something runs it.** Measured on 2026-09-02: nothing in the suite or CI had
  ever diffed a JIT-on run against a JIT-off run; the JIT's tests were
  hand-written expectations (the one-sided-verifiability class), which is how
  #1063's JIT half — an inline `SET_LOCAL` that recorded no history — went
  unnoticed. Every corpus program now runs with the JIT off recording a tape,
  then replays that tape under the default JIT and with the OSR threshold lowered
  (`EIGS_JIT_OSR_THRESHOLD=1`); stdout, stderr and exit code must be
  byte-identical. A divergence is adjudicated by determinism first (both sides
  rerun; a stable pair is the JIT's) and by tape replay second (the
  interpreter records, the JIT arm replays, which pins a `random`-seeded
  program to the reference run) — in that order, because replay alone
  laundered a deterministic line-stamp divergence. Divergences that
  are known and filed live in `tests/jit_diff_expected.txt`, a ledger to work
  down. Its own CI job. First reading: #1071 (the `at <module>` line in a
  trace for an error raised inside `sandbox_run` is wrong in every tier and
  differs by tier).

### Fixed

- **Imported loop locals and runtime `eval` keep their scope and file (#1056).**
  A plain `is` inside an imported module's `for` first updates an existing
  loop-local, while fresh bindings remain in the module. The original f29
  fixtures stopped native compilation at `LOOP_ENV_CLEAR`; their lowered-threshold
  runs did not test native writes. Six new `native_*` road fixtures now run
  under interpreter, default JIT, and a lowered OSR threshold on x86-64.
  The same compiled chunk is exercised with the OSR threshold lowered; both
  native arms compile code and must agree. Statistics do not count OSR entries
  or prove that the two native arms use distinct entry mechanisms.
  For `native_inline` on x86-64: interpreter `scanned=0 compiled=0`, both
  native tiers `scanned=2 compiled=1`. Creating a local mid-thunk previously
  yielded 19999 instead of 14999; imported inline stores now use the helper
  whenever an intervening scope can hold a nearer binding.
  Runtime `eval` in a function retains the function's defining directory
  during another module's import and `eigs_eval_file`. The embed API now
  scopes its directory override to compilation, matching import and load_file.
  `tools/embed_roads.py` checks both embed eval APIs and the override during
  execution. Its C test reuses a uniquely identified make variant, or builds
  from the plain source list when the CLI is standalone (build.sh) or its
  variant is ambiguous; ASAN_OPTIONS requests an ASan fallback. It never
  relinks the CLI. Selftests cover these layouts, an execution-scope override,
  invalid/duplicate native headers, and the lowered threshold reaching the child.
  The oracle requires completion after readback and names malformed metadata;
  its selftest rejects early-exit snapshot forgery. Generated test modules use
  their test file's canonical directory in both in-tree and installed layouts.

- **A descriptor reading observer state of an unrecorded host binding raises
  instead of answering a rest value (#1027).** With the #915 gate closed for
  the host program (nothing compiled into it reads the observer), a chunk run
  through `vm_run_bytecode` / `sandbox_run` that reported, predicated or
  snapshotted a HOST binding got `equilibrium` / 0 / an empty trajectory —
  silently, rc 0 — because the host's assignments were never recorded. The
  reader opcodes (`REPORT_*`, `REPORT_VALUE_*`, `TRAJECTORY_*`,
  `PREDICATE_*`, the bare `OP_PREDICATE`) now raise a value error when the
  chunk is descriptor-origin (`compiler_scanned == 0`), the slot has no
  recorded history, and the state has a recording gap (`obs_history_gap`:
  recording switched on after execution began, which is exactly what the
  descriptor's own arming does in a closed-gate program). A binding the
  descriptor itself observed, a state whose gate was open from the start
  (a compiled reader, `EIGS_OBS_FORCE=1`, the AOT's boot arming) and every
  unreachable reader are untouched — the three static guards the issue
  tried could not make that distinction. Pinned by
  `tests/test_desc_unrecorded_read.eigs`.
- **Tape replay fidelity (#1072): arguments are validated before the replay
  boundary, the history table promotes arena values, and a same-binary
  record-vs-replay gate exists.** `recv`/`try_recv`/`recv_timeout`/
  `exec_capture`/`proc_spawn` checked `replay_blocks()` before validating their
  arguments, so a deterministic type error (`try_recv of 42`: value kind,
  "invalid channel") replayed as an io "not replayable" error — a same-binary
  tape that did not reproduce its own recording on a program with no
  concurrency in it (`test_builtin_errors` BE07). The five now validate first.
  (`tests/test_replay.sh`'s boundary probe `proc_spawn of ["true"]` passed the
  STRING "true" under the #405 call convention and only "refused" because the
  block ran first; it now passes `[["true"]]`, a well-formed call.)
  Separately, `EIGS_TRACE` on `test_arena_escape` crashed at shutdown: the
  prev/history table retained ARENA-allocated slots without promoting them
  (the #873 rule), `arena_reset` reclaimed them, and `trace_thread_release`
  freed reclaimed memory; `prev_record_assign` now promotes before retaining.
  `tools/replay_diff.sh` (CI lane `replay differential`, twin of `jit_diff.sh`)
  records and replays every corpus program with the JIT off on both sides;
  divergences at the documented subprocess/concurrency boundary are counted,
  not rows; a program that is not deterministic against itself is NONDET;
  anything else is ledgered in `tests/replay_diff_expected.txt` (a ledger to
  work down, never an amnesty). Suite section `[0e]` runs `test_arena_escape`
  under `EIGS_TRACE` so the record-mode crash class stays caught in the plain
  lane too.
- **Heap-use-after-free: a chunk compiled on a worker escaped through a
  channel and outlived the worker's intern table (#1065).** `env_intern_name`
  interns into a PER-THREAD table that `eigs_thread_drain_caches` freed at
  detach; a chunk compiled on the worker (`eval` inside the worker body)
  carries pointers into it (`const_interns[]`, and since #1063 `local_names[]`)
  and can escape as a function value. Every later call on main read freed
  memory (ASan: heap-use-after-free in `env_hash_find` under `GET_NAME`; the
  release binary printed `undefined variable '<garbage>'` once the bytes were
  reused). The table is now a REFCOUNTED object (`EnvInternTable`): the thread
  holds one ref, every chunk created on the thread holds one (`chunk_new` /
  `chunk_decref`), and the table frees on the last release — exactly as long
  as any pointer into it can be used, no longer. (The first cut parked every
  detaching thread's table on an orphan list; the HTTP RSS-growth gate caught
  it at ~22 KB per request, because a connection worker compiles the request
  payload and detaches 2000 times.) Pinned by `tests/test_worker_intern_escape.eigs`
  (release half; the suite's ASan lane is the real check — red on the pre-fix
  build) and by the RSS-growth gate staying at 0 kB.
- **Falsy-path family: a wrong-typed path argument raises under `EIGS_STRICT`
  (#1008, the remaining half).** `file_exists`, `is_dir`, `is_file`,
  `read_text`, `read_bytes`, `ls`, `mkdir` and `env_get` answered `0` / `""` /
  `[]` / `null` for a non-string argument, so a type mistake read as "not
  there" and nothing distinguished it from an absent path. Decided as the
  reform's other guards were: the documented answer stays for a real path
  that is absent; a non-string is a type error under strict and byte-identical
  otherwise. Two macro shapes carry it because these builtins are TAPED:
  `ARG_GUARD_TAPED` (the soft half is still a `TRACE_NONDET_RET`, so replay
  serves the recorded answer) and `ARG_GUARD_PRETAKE` for the early-take pair
  in `read_text`/`read_bytes` (the check moves before the take, so a strict
  raise neither consumes nor records a tape entry). `tools/strict_differential.sh`
  derives guarded names from all three macro spellings and carries a probe
  and a valid-input row per builtin.
- **`sandbox_run`: a bare `OP_PREDICATE` read the HOST's last observed binding
  (#1026).** The bare form consults no env: it reads the thread's
  last-observed-slot tracker, which the host's last `OP_OBSERVE_NAME_POST`
  set, so a descriptor with no operands and no host reference answered
  questions about a host value from inside the sealed env (measured: a flat
  host value read `equilibrium` = 1; six kinds, six bits per probe). The
  tracker is cleared for the run and restored after it, so every bare
  predicate in the sandbox answers 0 and the host's next bare predicate still
  reads the host. Pinned by `tests/test_sandbox_predicate_isolation.eigs`,
  whose probes sit at module level on purpose (through a helper function the
  tracker already points elsewhere and the leak does not show).
- **Stack traces from a chunk a builtin runs printed the host frame at a
  stale line (#1071).** `CASE(CALL)`, `CASE(DISPATCH)` and the JIT call helper never
  published the resume ip before invoking a builtin, so when `sandbox_run`,
  `vm_run_bytecode`, `eval`, `dispatch` or a comparator pushed frames and the
  child's uncaught error printed a trace, `vm_print_stack_trace` read the host
  frame's line from whatever ip the last frame push had left (`test_vm_run_bytecode`:
  `at <module> (line 100)` for a `sandbox_run` on line 106). The three sites
  store the resume ip first; the JIT helper restores the thunk-entry ip after
  the call, because a thunk's exit adds its relative advance to that base
  (leaving the call-site ip there resumed the interpreter misaligned — a
  constants[-1] read after an OSR'd loop called `adler32`). Pinned by
  `tests/test_host_frame_line.eigs`. #1071 was the same stale read seen from
  the JIT side (interpreter, default JIT and lowered-threshold JIT each printed a different wrong
  host line for `test_sandbox_budget`); the three tiers now agree, and its row
  leaves `tests/jit_diff_expected.txt`, which is empty. Found by the AOT's
  byte-exact corpus: the compiled program printed the correct line and the VM
  did not.
- **A `for` binder's observer history is per iteration on every loop-env tier (#1062).**
  The persist-overwrite tier skipped the per-iteration LOOP_ENV_CLEAR, which is
  what resets the binder's observer slot, so `observe of i` inside a loop
  accumulated across iterations when `i` was bound before the loop and reset
  when it was not: identical bodies, different classifications. A loop whose
  body or iterable reads the observer now stays on the CLEAR tier; unobserved
  loops keep the overwrite tier and its inline-cache win. Test
  `tests/test_for_binder_observer_tier.eigs`.
- **GC: both cycle-collection triggers are cost-aware (#1096).** A collection
  walks everything reachable from its seeds, but the possible-root buffer
  collected at a fixed 1024 registrations and the captured-env trigger
  re-armed at `2 * live`, neither knowing the size of the walk. The AOT
  compiler on a 400-statement input ran 990 collections in 6 s (each over
  ~2800 objects, 0 live captured envs); at 1600 statements the collector was
  62-70% of an 82-second compile, quadratic in program size. Both thresholds
  now re-arm from the size of the last universe walked (the possible-root
  threshold to that size, floor 1024; the captured-env threshold by at least
  a sixteenth of it), so amortised collection cost per registration is O(1).
  Programs whose heap is mostly captured envs keep the old cadence.
- **A `for` binder over an existing frame slot is restored after the loop (#1064).**
  Inside a function, a binder whose name already had a slot (a parameter, a
  `local`, an earlier assignment) reused it and the loop's last value leaked:
  `define f(p): for p in [7, 8]: p is p + 10` returned 18 for `p`. The
  compiler saves the pre-loop value in a hidden slot and restores it at loop
  exit (exhausted and break paths), so LANGUAGE_CONTRACT's "does not leak"
  holds inside functions; a binder with no prior binding keeps its
  function-scoped slot, now stated in the contract. Test
  `tests/test_for_binder_scoped_in_function.eigs` (9 rows).
- **A `for` binder in a loop env is written where its body reads it (#1074).**
  An interrogated binder, or one shadowing a module/outer name, lives in a
  per-iteration loop env; the body's write of that name was routed to the
  function env by name, so `for p in [7, 8]: p is p + 10; print of p` printed
  7 8 (the binder) and the read after the loop printed 18. The compiler keeps
  a stack of the function's active loop-env binders and emits
  OP_SET_NAME_LOCAL for their writes; the body sees 17 18, the binder stays
  loop-scoped, and the module `p` is untouched. Test
  `tests/test_for_binder_loopenv_write.eigs` (9 rows, 4 failed before).
- **The suite refuses a stale `src/eigenscript` (#1089).** `run_all_tests.sh`
  now asks the build system (`make -q build/<variant>/eigenscript`, the
  variant being whatever the alias is hard-linked to) before recording the
  #681 fingerprint, rebuilds through the variant's goal with a visible NOTE
  when the binary is older than its sources, and refuses to run if that
  rebuild fails. Bought when a `make` that died on a compile error left a
  debug build linked and the suite reported 25 failures against sources
  that no longer contained the debug print.
- **Env growth allocations are checked (`xrealloc`, #1085).** The four
  env-growth blocks in eigenscript.c (`names`/`values`/`assign_counts`,
  twelve `p = realloc(p, n)` sites) and lint's W022 function table were the
  unchecked remainder of the bare-realloc sweep: three of the four blocks
  never tested `assign_counts` at all, and every one overwrote the old
  pointer before testing it. They go through `xrealloc` now, and their
  hand-written "Out of memory growing env" checks are gone with the NULL
  they guarded. The remaining bare `realloc`s (jit chunk registry, tape
  reader, trace rings, lint sets) each test the result and degrade on
  purpose, and are left as they are.
- **`return x * y` in a leaf callee sets the underflow flag (#1079).** The
  #366 frameless leaf-accessor path evaluates a single-expression callee in
  its own mini-evaluator, and its multiply lacked the underflow rule that
  `NUM_BINOP(MUL)` applies: `scale of [1e-200, 1e-200]` returned 0 with
  `math_flags["underflow"]` still 0, while binding the same product to a
  local inside the callee (generic path) set it. Zero from two nonzero
  operands now sets the flag there too; `tests/test_math_underflow.eigs`
  pins both shapes (plant-verified: the leaf case goes red with the fix
  reverted).
- **A named native function observes like a user function.** `compute_entropy`
  answers 1.0 for a `make_native_fn` value (as for `VAL_FN`) and 0.0 for a
  plain builtin, so a number rebound to an AOT-compiled function carries the
  same observe tuple as on the VM (ouroboros#193: `["opaque", 0, ...]` vs
  the VM's `["opaque", 1, ...]`). Pinned in `tests/test_native_fn.c`.
- **A native function can carry a name and report as `fn` (#1060).**
  `make_native_fn(fn, "NAME")` boxes a C function as a `VAL_BUILTIN` whose
  pointer is registered with a name: `type of` answers `fn`, printing and
  `str of` show `<fn NAME>`, every call path is unchanged, and an
  unregistered builtin keeps `builtin` / `<builtin>`. Only a linked runtime
  makes one -- the AOT, which compiles user functions to C and until now
  could only present them as `<builtin>` (ouroboros#174, silent-wrong on
  `type of X == "builtin"` discriminators). `eigs_native_fn_name(fn)`
  answers the registry; `tests/test_native_fn.c` (suite [0c], `make
  nativefn-test`) pins both identities and the call-through.
- **Chunk growth allocations are checked (`xrealloc`).** Eight bare
  `realloc`s in chunk.c (constant pool, code, line/column tables, inline
  caches, function table) returned NULL into a `memset` under a 60 MB
  address-space limit: SIGSEGV where every other growth path prints
  "out of memory" and aborts. Found by the observer-gate OOM probe once
  #1031 moved the first out-of-memory allocation from the eager pass's
  compile into `load_file`'s own.
  The same probe on the `full` (postgres) CI lane then segfaulted inside
  `name_set_add`: the layout there put the first failing allocation in the
  compiler's name-set growth (`ulimit -v 65000` reproduces it locally on a
  `make full` build). Its three bare `realloc`s (name sets, two
  `local_names` growths) are `xrealloc` too; the sweep of the remaining
  bare sites outside chunk.c is #1085.

- **The observer gate's eager pass no longer compiles each literal module
  (#1031).** It tokenized, parsed and `compile_ast`'d every literally-loaded
  module just to learn whether it reads the observer, then freed the chunk;
  `load_file` compiled the same file again (no module cache, by design).
  The compiled chunk was never reusable (`compile_ast` numbers module slots
  from the env it is given), so the pass now answers from the AST: an
  interrogative, a predicate, an import, or any observer builtin's name arms
  it; `load_file` may appear only as an `of` call on a string literal, whose
  path joins the scan, and any other use is opaque — the same two rules the
  chunk scan applied to bytecode. Measured on `load_file of "lib/ui.eigs"`
  (20 units): 0.11 s before, 0.08 s after, against 0.05 s for the computed
  spelling that skips the pass — the compile half of the double work is
  gone; the second tokenize+parse remains. Gate verdicts are unchanged
  (20 unobserved units on both builds; the corpus oracle agrees).

- **A builtin's line-0 raise with no live VM frame reports the trace stamp
  (#1082).** `vm_current_line` answered 0 whenever no interpreter frame was
  live, so a native (AOT) binary calling the linked builtins printed
  `Error line 0:` for every builtin-raised error while its own helpers,
  which pass `g_trace_current_line`, printed the right line. With no VM or
  no live frame it now answers the trace stamp; inside the interpreter
  nothing changes (the stamp is the OP_LINE value there). Suite section
  [0b] (`tests/test_error_line_fallback.c`) raises from outside any frame
  with the stamp set, cleared, and with an explicit line.

- **`sandbox_run` snapshots the module env under its lock (#1035).** The
  allowlist walk read `g_global_env`'s names/count without the module-env
  lock while pthread workers bound new names under it (TSan, ~1 in 6 runs);
  the names are now snapshotted under `g_module_env_lock` (an exported pair,
  `env_global_shared_lock/unlock`, a no-op until the process goes
  multithreaded) and bound into the sandbox env outside it — the sandbox
  env is a sealed root, so binding under the lock re-took it and deadlocked.
  `tsan_sandbox_snapshot_race.eigs` joins the TSan slice.
- **The sandbox result walk's dead key promotion is deleted (#1014).**
  `sandbox_value_has_callable`'s `promote_keys` branch re-homed escaping
  dict keys in a second pass at the result boundary, but `dict_set_hashed`
  promotes at insertion whenever a sandbox intern scope is open, so that
  pass changed 0 of 128 keys (measured in the issue). The walk keeps its one
  job, callable detection; the mutation that survived the suite no longer
  exists to survive.

- **`vm_run_bytecode`: a descriptor that declares local slots runs in its
  own frame env (#1030).** A top-level descriptor was executed in the
  caller's env, and `OP_SET_LOCAL 0` wrote the HOST's slot 0 — decref'ing
  the host's own first binding, which the host then read (heap-use-after-free
  under ASan, a clobbered value without it). Every descriptor now runs in a
  fresh child env (name resolution still walks to the host): a
  slot-declaring one gets its own slots, and a slot-less one's `SET_LOCAL 0`
  is out of range there and raises (#348) instead of writing the global
  env's slot 0 — measured on the pinned binary, that write turned `print`
  into the number 7. The ABI test pins both shapes.
- **`must_not_yield`'s region counter is per thread (#1036).** It was a
  process-global int with non-atomic `++`/`--`; two pthread workers raced
  (TSan 3/3) and a lost decrement left it stuck nonzero, poisoning every
  later guarded operation process-wide. Thread-local storage is the exact
  scope (a region belongs to the thread that entered it). The TSan CI slice
  gains `tsan_no_yield_race.eigs` (two workers, 1000 regions each).

- **Boolean env flags share one convention (#1032).** Half the tree read
  booleans by PRESENCE (`if (getenv(...))`), so `EIGS_JIT_OFF=0` turned the
  JIT off and `EIGS_OBS_FORCE=0` forced the observer gate open (#915). One
  helper, `eigs_env_flag` (`src/env_flag.h`: non-empty and not `"0"` = on),
  now serves every boolean site — the 18 presence-tested flags (20 sites) across
  jit.c, eigenscript.c, main.c, repl.c, builtins*.c and model_train.c, and
  the three hand-written convention-A sites (`EIGS_STRICT`,
  `EIGS_VERIFY_SELF`, `EIGS_REPLAY_STRICT`, `EIGS_OBS_FORCE`, `EIGS_OBS_GATE_STATS`).
  Value-carrying variables (paths, thresholds, prefixes) keep `getenv`.
  Suite section [99y] pins `EIGS_JIT_OFF=0` / `=` / `=1` and
  `EIGS_JIT_STATS=0` against the JIT's own stats line.

- **`state_at` keys come out in name order (#1029).** The prev table is
  bucketed by the interned name's ADDRESS, so the dump's key order moved
  with ASLR (seven orders in eight runs of one program) and `EIGS_REPLAY`
  diverged from its own recording — ordering is output, not a
  nondeterminism record, so the tape could not pin it. The walk now sorts
  the live entries by name before building the dict. Suite section [99x]
  runs eight fresh processes, requires one distinct output in name order,
  and requires a recording to equal its replay.

- **`file_exists` never blocks (#1070).** It was an `fopen` probe, and `fopen`
  on a reader-less fifo (or a device that blocks on open) never returned — the
  program hung with no diagnostic while `is_file` on the same path answered 0
  at once. A `stat` probe now; directories and devices still read 1.
  `tests/test_file_exists_fifo.sh` opens a fifo under a 5-second timeout.
- **`copy_into` is loud, and takes a buffer destination (#1069).** Every
  failure returned null silently — wrong arity, a non-number offset, a bad
  type — including the argument order `docs/BUILTINS.md` itself listed
  (`[dest, src, offset]`; the code has always read `[dest, offset, src]`, and
  the doc now says so). A buffer destination copies numbers from a buffer or
  a list of numbers, and a non-number element raises the #1061 message. A
  negative offset raises too (`tests/test_copy_into_neg.eigs` pinned the old
  silent null and now pins the raise). `log`/`sqrt` of a buffer (the other
  half of #1069) is the #971 `ARG_GUARD` flip-to-default question, not a new
  hole, and is left to it.
- **An interrogative inside a list comprehension arms the name (#1075).**
  `scan_for_interrogated` treated `AST_LISTCOMP` as a no-op, so
  `[prev of y for v in xs]` answered `[null]` while `prev of y` one line
  outside answered the value. Found by ouroboros's self-host parity tier at
  the pin bump onto #1063: the self-hosted compiler's chunks (a non-compiler
  producer, every slot recorded) answered `[1]` and the C compiler `[null]`.
  The comprehension runs in the enclosing frame, so its operands arm that
  frame's names. `tests/test_listcomp_interrogate.eigs`.
- **An interrogated parameter was half slot, half name (#1063).** A `for`
  binder over a parameter, in a function that also says `prev of p` or
  `what is p at L` anywhere, was sent to a loop env while the body's reads
  stayed on the parameter's frame slot — `for p in [7, 8]: print of p`
  printed the incoming argument twice and the binder never persisted. And
  `SET_LOCAL` recorded history under the chunk's `strdup`'d slot name, a
  pointer the pointer-keyed `prev` table never matches against a query's
  interned constant, so `prev of t` after two rebinds of a parameter answered
  `null`. Slot names are now interned at chunk build (same provenance as the
  constant table), a name that already has a slot keeps the slot for its
  binder, and the JIT's `SET_LOCAL` takes an out-of-line helper when history
  is armed — exactly as its `SET_NAME` arms already did — so the tape keeps
  filling past the OSR threshold (it froze at 4999 of 199999 before). A slot
  write records only when the chunk that owns the slot interrogates the name
  (`local_traced`, the rule name-routing already applied) — the history table
  is keyed by name across all frames, and recording every function's slot
  writes let a callee's same-named local rewrite the caller's `prev` (the
  observer cross-repo corpus caught it: `dynamics__physics`' frame velocity
  read 0 instead of -0.38). An untraced slot write still lands on the tape as
  an `A` record — the DAP stepper stops on those, and the suite's DAP section
  went red when the first cut dropped them — it just enters no history. A
  function compiled on the main thread keys the same history entry whichever
  thread runs it (the chunk carries the compiler's interned pointer, not a
  per-thread re-interning). The other direction — a chunk compiled INSIDE a
  worker escaping through a channel — is the pre-existing per-thread
  intern-table lifetime hole, now filed as #1065 (it already bites
  `const_interns` on main). `tests/test_temporal_param.eigs` pins every
  parameter row against its `local` twin, including the 200k-iteration OSR
  rows and a `spawn`ed worker; `test_temporal_producers.eigs` pins the
  `vm_run_bytecode` descriptor path. Fixture fails 12 checks on the previous
  release.

- **Storing a non-number into a buffer element now raises (#1061).** It was
  the last fail-soft numeric context: `b[0] is "hello"` silently DROPPED the
  store (the old element stayed) at rc 0 while `s * 2` one line later died.
  `cannot store str in a buffer (buffers hold numbers)` on the opcode path
  and its JIT helper; `buf_set` checks both operands (they were read through
  the num union unchecked — the #1007 type-pun class); `buf_from_list` names
  the offending element instead of leaving 0.0. Booleans are numbers and
  still store as 1/0. `tests/test_buffer_store_type.eigs`, including the
  hot-loop shape where the JIT's inline write bails to the helper.
- **`observe of <never-bound name>` dies like every other read (#1059).** It
  was the one read-shaped form that tolerated an unbound operand (a silent
  no-observation tuple). Same `undefined variable 'v'` as `print of v` in the
  same position; a bound name observes as before. The AOT's carve-out for
  this case (ouroboros t124) can go at the next pin bump.
- **`log` no longer floors tiny POSITIVE inputs (#1041).** `log of 1e-15`
  answered ln(1e-10) with no flag — a silent plateau that a log-domain decay
  fit rode to a confidently wrong answer inside a written 2% tolerance
  (phugoid G3). ln of any positive double is finite, so only a non-positive
  or NaN input takes the #865 stand-in (and sets the `invalid` flag), for the
  scalar op and the tensor `log` alike. `docs/BUILTINS.md` says so now.
- **`linalg.solve_linear` raises on a singular system (#1047)** —
  `solve_linear: singular system -- pivot |0| < 1e-12 at column 2 (no unique
  solution)` — instead of returning a null the caller indexes three frames
  later. `mat_inverse` is the same shape and raises the same way (its
  `singular inverse is null` test row now asserts the raise).
- **`env_hash_find_dict` is declared in `eigenscript.h` (#1055).** It was
  exported from `eigenscript.c` with no declaration; the one in-tree caller
  carried an `extern`, and out-of-tree callers (the AOT's inline caches) got
  an implicit declaration that GCC 14 rejects.

## [0.42.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- **`lib/complex.eigs` — complex arithmetic, polar form and polynomial roots
  (#1043).** Mode analysis, signal processing and root finding are all
  intrinsically complex-valued, and every consumer was re-rolling the same
  arithmetic on `[re, im]` pairs — including the stdlib itself, where
  `engineering.magnitude_spectrum` and `power_spectrum` were hand-rolled
  moduli. Adds `add`/`sub`/`mul`/`div`/`neg`/`conj`/`scale`/`mag`/`mag2`/
  `arg`, `to_polar`/`from_polar`, `eq_near`, and `poly_eval`/`poly_roots`
  (Durand-Kerner). `div` returns `null` on a zero denominator rather than
  raising, which is what lets `poly_roots` hold an iterate at a repeated root
  instead of dying on it.

  Its tests are DIRECT unit checks against hand-computed values, deliberately:
  a differential oracle is structurally blind here — phugoid measured a halved
  `div` surviving a full root-finding differential, because Durand-Kerner
  self-corrects under a scaled delta. That exact fault is planted in
  `tests/test_complex.eigs`.

- **`linalg.charpoly` and `linalg.eigenvalues` — general eigenvalues (#1042).**
  `linalg` stopped at `eigenvalues_2x2`, which returns `null` for any complex
  spectrum (a rotation matrix's ±i read as "no answer"), and `numerics` offered
  only the dominant real eigenvalue. `charpoly` is Faddeev-LeVerrier for any
  square n; `eigenvalues` returns all n as complex pairs. Graded on a 4x4 with
  a known complex spectrum by the identities that tie the answer back to the
  matrix rather than the solver — sum of eigenvalues = `mat_trace`, product =
  `mat_det` — plus a residual check per eigenvalue.

- **`engineering.phase_spectrum` (#1043).** The missing sibling of
  `magnitude_spectrum`/`power_spectrum`, which now delegate to `complex.mag`
  and `complex.mag2` (verified byte-identical to the hand-rolled versions
  across four signals). A spectrum has a phase as well as a magnitude; it was
  absent because the arithmetic to express it did not exist.

  `linalg` and `engineering` are the first stdlib modules to import another
  (`complex`). Every `lib/*.eigs` is installed together, so the dependency
  travels with them.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **The observer gate ships: programs that provably never read observer state
  skip entropy bookkeeping entirely (#915).** Decided per compiled unit at
  compile time (opcode scan + observer-builtin name scan + eager compilation of
  string-literal `load_file` targets, so a clean module tree still gates), per
  `EigsState` at run time. **8.51x on EigenMiniSat's 4x4 Tseitin workload**
  (n=5 interleaved, one binary, solver counters identical across arms) — the
  ungated observer walk was 88% of that workload's runtime. Byte-identical on a
  416-program corpus against a pre-gate build. Conservative everywhere the
  scan cannot be sure: computed load paths, aliasing, `eval`, `import`,
  multithreaded compiles, and anything over the 1 MiB speculative-read budget
  keep full observation; a module rewritten between scan and load raises
  loudly rather than answering from a gap. `EIGS_OBS_FORCE=1` restores
  pre-gate behaviour exactly; `EIGS_OBS_GATE_STATS=1` prints per-unit
  verdicts. Verified by a nineteen-round adversarial loop plus the full CI
  matrix; suite section [99u] pins 44 checks over the gate's mechanisms.
  Residuals are filed, not hidden: #1031 (literal modules compile twice;
  budget-bounded), #1027 (descriptor pre-call history), #1032/#1033 (minor).
  The observer arming flags and trace-history flags are now relaxed-atomic —
  fixing a data race reachable from worker threads (also present, unfixed,
  in three pre-existing sites now ledgered on #1035/#1036).

- **Every opcode now carries a recorded observer classification, and a gate
  fails on any that does not (#972).** The optimisation this unblocks — stop
  emitting observer bookkeeping when a program provably never reads observer
  state — fails silently and totally when its reader set is incomplete: a
  program gates its own bookkeeping off, then reads slots nobody updated, and
  every binding answers `equilibrium` forever with no crash and nothing to fail
  on. So the reader set has to be pinned against the closed opcode list.
  **It cannot be derived from the C.** Five derivations were tried and all five
  gave a confident wrong answer, in both directions: a grep of the read-side API
  and `objdump -dr` relocations both miss `obs_stall_trajectory()`, which reads
  `s->dH`/`s->entropy` as struct fields and so calls nothing and references no
  symbol; a struct-field scan false-positives on unrelated `->n` reads; a
  handler scan written against `case OP_X:` matches **nothing** (the VM
  dispatches through `CASE(NAME)` computed-goto macros) and reports a clean
  empty set; and the same scan repaired to `CASE(X)` matches **everything**,
  including a scope marker and a writer.
  So nothing is derived. All 94 opcodes were classified by reading their
  handlers, and `src/vm.h` records the verdict as `obs:READS` (15),
  `obs:WRITES` (10), `obs:DIAG` (1) or `obs:NONE` (68).
  `tools/obs_marker_check.sh` (suite section `[99t]`) enumerates the enum and
  goes red on any opcode with no marker — so a new opcode is a red line at the
  moment it is added, which is when its author knows the answer and nobody else
  ever will. A missing marker produces a loud unanswered question where a
  derivation produced a confident wrong one.
  Two verdicts contradict their opcode names and are worth knowing before
  touching this area: `OP_OBSERVE_ASSIGN` is a **no-op** (the slot model
  observes at `OP_OBSERVE_NAME_POST`, after the SET), and the bare
  `OP_INTERROGATE` reads **no** observer state at all — `when`/`where`/`why`/
  `how` on a value operand return constants, because observer state is
  binding-keyed and a bare value has no binding. `obs:DIAG` exists for
  `OP_LOOP_CAP_CHECK`, whose only reach into observer state is the SIGUSR1
  dump: calling it a reader would pin bookkeeping on for every plain loop in
  every program and delete the whole win, and calling it `NONE` would silently
  drop the obligation that the dump must say the gate is closed rather than
  render every binding as `equilibrium`.
  No runtime change: the markers are comments and the gate is a test.

- **`make embed-concurrent` — the multi-state embedding promise is now tested,
  not just asserted (#885).** `docs/EMBEDDING.md` says a process may hold
  multiple `EigsState` instances *concurrently* and that each is independent.
  Nothing tested the concurrent half: `pthread_create` appeared nowhere in
  `src/embed_smoke.c` or any test script, and the one multi-state case that
  existed is explicitly sequential — it covers SWITCHING, not INDEPENDENCE.
  Three assertions, two states on two OS threads, 200 interleaved rounds each:
  per-state **observer thresholds**, per-state **global bindings** (the same
  name holding a different value in each state), and **error-flag isolation**
  (an uncaught error in one state leaves the other's flag clear).
  **It carries its own control row**, and that row is the reason the other
  three mean anything: a deliberately shared file-scope global that MUST show
  cross-talk under the same harness. The first version's control reported
  `A=0 B=0` — the compiler kept the value in a register and the threads never
  interleaved — which would have made three green rows uninformative. With
  `volatile` and a yield between write and read it reports ~167/200, and a
  mutation replacing a per-state read with that shared static is caught.
  The promise holds today by construction (nearly every `g_*` name is a macro
  onto `eigs_current->…`), which is exactly why this needed a gate: a future
  counter added as a file-scope `static` looks correct in every
  single-threaded test in the repo.
  Two of the three assertions had to be rewritten after a single-threaded
  baseline: `observer_set`/`observer_get` do not exist (it is
  `set_observer_thresholds of [dh_zero, dh_small, h_low]`), and `sandbox_run`
  takes an ABI-stamped bytecode descriptor rather than a source string and a
  budget dict — so the issue's suggested per-thread-budget row would have
  tested descriptor assembly as much as isolation, and per-state globals
  replace it. Baseline single-threaded before blaming concurrency.

- **W023 warns about inverted sibling-branch outer mutation (#870).** When
  sibling `if`/`elif`/`else` branches assign the same name with and without
  `local`, the linter warns only when the compiler model proves the bare write
  can reach a module binding; uncertain binder shapes remain silent.

- **Strict math mode (`EIGS_STRICT=1`) — out-of-domain ops raise instead of
  substituting (#971).** By default arithmetic is finite by construction: `sqrt`
  of a negative → `0`, `log` of `≤0` → a stand-in, `asin`/`acos` outside
  `[-1, 1]` → clamped, each recording the sticky `invalid` math-flag. Those
  substitutions keep kernels/graders running but launder an out-of-domain
  argument into a plausible finite result. With `EIGS_STRICT=1` (per-`EigsState`,
  read once at creation) each such op raises a catchable `value` error instead —
  for callers, e.g. a generated-code grader, that need arithmetic invalidity to
  be loud. Default behavior is unchanged (zero blast radius); overflow saturation
  and the `NaN`→`0` collapse are not yet gated by the flag. First cut of the
  observer-honesty half of the #975 ledger; the reframe (raise-under-strict, not
  "route invalid values through the observer") is because the collapse target `0`
  is indistinguishable from a real `0` and the substituted values must stay for
  kernels.

### Changed

- **The strict argument reform now covers the whole builtin surface, and
  every fail-soft return in it is classified (#971 Phase B).** Phase A
  converted the outer *arity* guards and left the inner *element-type*
  checks soft, so a call with the right shape and the wrong element types
  was still answered silently — `contains of [[1,2,3], 2]` returned `0`
  under strict, in a function whose own comment describes that spurious hit
  as a fixed bug. 45 further guards are converted, in `builtins.c`,
  `builtins_host.c`, `builtins_tensor.c` and `ext_store.c`.
  **Two findings changed the shape of the work.** First, the population was
  bigger than the issue's: its "~89 guards" came from a narrow
  `return make_num(0)` grep over one file, which missed every
  `make_num(0.0)` spelling (ten in `builtins_tensor.c`, one of them a
  textbook null guard) and never looked outside `builtins.c`. The real
  surface is **165 sites across seven files** — and the seventh, `src/hash.c`,
  was invisible even to the new gate until its builtin-name pattern learned
  about digits (`sha256`, `md5`, `hmac_sha256` all have one), while being
  compiled into every variant. Second, several guards were
  *mixed* — one condition OR-ing a type mistake with a documented answer
  (`task_send`'s arity check with "no scheduler"; `min`/`max`'s
  wrong-type with empty-list) — and those are split so strict speaks about
  the half it should while the non-strict answer is unchanged.
  A second macro, `STRICT_REQUIRE`, covers builtins that *coerce* instead of
  returning a stand-in: `str_replace` silently treated a non-string element
  as `""`, so it has no stand-in return to convert and no single soft value
  to preserve. It raises under strict and is a no-op otherwise, making the
  default path byte-identical by construction rather than by inspection.
  **Every one of the remaining 120 sites now carries a written
  classification** (`fs:ANSWER`, `fs:CHANNEL`, `fs:LITERAL`, `fs:EMPTY`,
  `fs:STRICT`, `fs:TODO`), enforced by `tools/failsoft_classify_check.sh` —
  because the distinction is not derivable from the code, only from reading
  it, and an unmarked new site must be a red line rather than a silent
  omission. 17 sites are `fs:TODO #971`, all in the variant-only extension
  builds (gfx/http), which no test in a default build can exercise.
  Verified by `tools/strict_differential.sh` against a build of the parent
  commit: **52/53 probes byte-identical with the flag off, 53/53 raising
  under strict, 10/10 answer-pins held**. The one divergence is
  `sign_extend`, which was not fail-softness but a union type-pun — both
  operands were read as `.data.num` with no `VAL_NUM` check, so
  `sign_extend of ["x", 8]` reinterpreted a `char *` as a `double`. The
  waiver is proven rather than asserted: the harness runs the baseline twice
  and requires the two results to differ, which they do (a different
  pointer-derived denormal each run).
  Three separate bugs found while reading and filed rather than folded in:
  `store_update` reports success after deleting a record when the re-insert
  fails (#1006), `ext_gfx.c` has no raise path at all against ~85 fail-soft
  returns (#1007), and `sum`/`mean`/`norm` launder a wrong-typed argument to
  `0` through `tensor_total` (#1008).

- **`EIGS_STRICT=1` now makes a wrong-typed builtin argument raise (#971
  Phase A).** ~34 builtins answered a wrong type with a soft stand-in, so a
  type mistake became a plausible value and flowed on indistinguishable from a
  real one: `cos of "hello"` was `0`, `str_upper of 42` was `""`,
  `substr of 42` was `""`. That is the fail-soft default the #975 reform
  exists to remove, and it is exactly what made a grader score a laundered
  answer instead of catching the mistake.
  **Default behaviour is byte-identical** — the stand-in is still returned
  with the flag off. Under `EIGS_STRICT=1` the guard raises a catchable
  `type` error naming the builtin and what it wanted. Converted via a single
  `ARG_GUARD` macro so each site keeps its own early return and stays
  reviewable one guard at a time.
  The gate is renamed `strict_math` → `strict` (and `g_strict_math` →
  `g_strict`) in the same change, because it no longer governs only
  arithmetic domains. `EIGS_STRICT`, the user-facing knob, is unchanged and
  was always the general name.
  **The exclusions are the point of the phase.** The issue's "~89 guards" is
  a grep, not a population: a `sed` over `return make_num(0)` would have
  broken `try_parse of "!!!"` (whose `0` means *invalid syntax* — the answer)
  and `task_alive` of an unknown id (whose `0` means *not alive*, four lines
  below a type guard that DID convert). Both are pinned as tests that strict
  must leave alone. The 13 JSON-parser paths, which signal failure through
  their own flag channel, are untouched.
  Verified by differential against the pre-change binary: **35/35 probes
  byte-identical with the flag off, 35/35 raising under strict**; suite
  3985/3985; two planted faults (always-raise, never-raise) each caught by
  their own assertion.

- **`sandbox_run` charges every retained allocation and verifies its
  descriptor under bounded work (#965).** Pure string transforms
  (`str_lower`/`trim`/`substr`/`json_raw`/`str_from_bytes`, strbuf-backed
  encoders, `OP_ADD` concat and raw `OP_SLICE_GET` copies) allocated fresh
  payloads no allocator charged, so a loop re-using one charged input
  aggregated unbounded memory under an armed byte budget; the payload is now
  charged once at the constructor/ownership-transfer chokepoint, the first
  refusal is sticky for the whole run, and every attachable result — not only
  a successful one — is scanned for callables. Descriptor constant pools are
  additionally verified data-only under a shared node budget, so an aliased
  all-data container graph is refused (`{ok:0}`, `invalid chunk descriptor`)
  instead of driving an exponential walk before the sandbox's own bounds are
  armed. Programs that stayed inside the budget are unaffected; a program that
  was silently over it now gets `{ok:0}` with a `sandbox` error.
  Descriptor verification is now ONE context for the whole recursive graph
  rather than a bound per constant pool: a single work allowance, an explicit
  depth/back-edge bound, and the constants themselves are ISOLATED from the
  host. A per-chunk allowance was not a bound — nested function chunks
  multiplied it, so a graph whose children were each comfortably inside the
  limit was still accepted — and a constant retained by reference stayed the
  same object sandboxed code mutated, letting an allowlisted `append` attach a
  freshly created sandbox closure to a host-owned list without the value ever
  appearing in the returned result. The sandbox now runs against its own copy
  of every mutable constant (list/dict/buffer, cycles refused), and the
  allowlist copies only the pure C builtin each allowed name actually holds —
  a host-rebound allowed name gets the blocked stub instead of aliasing host
  state inward. Ordinary descriptors, including ones carrying nested function
  chunks and data constants, are unaffected.

- **Over-arity calls on multi-parameter functions now raise instead of
  silently dropping the extra arguments (#974).** With `define two(a, b)`,
  `two of [1, 2, 99]` used to bind `a = 1, b = 2` and discard `99` with no
  diagnostic at any stage — and lint `W022` only sees same-file callees, so
  the cross-module case had no guard at all. The call site now raises a
  catchable `value` error (`call passes 3 arguments but the callee takes 2`)
  in the interpreter and the JIT alike (`src/vm.c`), which is cross-file
  robust where W022 is structurally blind. The arity-1 re-collect carve-out
  is preserved (`one of [5, 6]` still binds the whole list, keeping
  `len of [1, 2]` and friends working), and under-arity still null-fills
  silently — making that loud is deferred follow-up work, not part of this
  change. The one corpus caller relying on the drop was the contract test
  itself (`tests/test_call_semantics.eigs`), migrated in the same change.

- **Division and modulo by zero now raise instead of yielding `0`.** `5 / 0`
  printed an uncatchable `stderr` warning and pushed `0`; `5 % 0` was fully
  silent and pushed `0` — a wrong *number* that flowed on indistinguishable
  from a real result, and the observer read the `0` as `converged`. Both now
  raise a `value` error (`src/vm.c`), catchable via `try`/`catch`, joining the
  type- and index-error reforms (#499/#680): an operation with no defined
  result asserts rather than inventing one. Deliberately unconditional (no
  strict-mode gate) — the `NaN`→`0` / overflow-saturation *collapse* is a
  defined finite result and is untouched here (it remains observable via the
  saturation→`diverging` path; making that channel loud is separate follow-up
  work). First cut of the "finish the fail-soft→loud reform" ledger.

- **Division and modulo by zero now RAISE instead of yielding 0 (#976).**
  The fail-soft zero was a wrong answer with nothing to fail on; both operators
  now produce a runtime error naming the operation. (`EIGS_STRICT` is not
  required — this is the default.)

### Fixed

- **`-Wmisleading-indentation` is an ERROR now, and the four `w023_walk`
  warnings behind #1013 are gone.** The issue reports them as new with #1012.
  They were — but the more useful fact is that **`-Wall` has always emitted
  this warning**, so they appeared in every build of this repo, in every
  variant, scrolling past as non-fatal noise that nothing escalated:

  ```
  src/lint.c:1400:9: warning: this 'for' clause does not guard...
   1400 |  for (...) W(n->data.cond.else_body[i]); break;
        |                                          ^ not guarded, but indented as if it were
  ```

  Fixed by putting the trailing statement on its own line at all four reported
  sites — and at three more the issue does not list, found by sweeping every
  file under every variant's defines rather than working the four line numbers.
  Tree total is now **0** with the warning on.
  The durable half is the escalation: `-Werror=misleading-indentation` joins
  `-Werror=switch` and `-Werror=comment` in `CFLAGS`, `ASAN_FLAGS`, every
  variant and `build.sh`, and joins `REQUIRED_FLAGS` in
  `tools/werror_switch_check.sh` so a recipe cannot quietly drop it. Both
  halves proven: re-planting the original one-line shape now **fails the
  build** (`error:`, rc=2, not a warning), and removing the flag from a single
  recipe makes the gate red naming `MISSING required flag(s) [build]`.
  Adding a required flag also broke three of that gate's own fixtures, each in
  a different way, and all three are worth the note: eight `expect_clean`
  shapes carried only the two old flags and correctly began reading as
  violations; two *mixed* fixtures (one clean invocation, one violating, in the
  same block) needed only their clean half updated, or they would have stopped
  testing attribution; and the integration mutation's VERIFICATION string went
  stale — the mutation drops `-Werror=comment` and keeps what follows, so a
  third flag landed between `-Werror=switch` and `-O2` and the grep reported
  *"the mutation was not planted"* when the planting was fine and the assertion
  about it was wrong. Widening a required set edits the fixtures too.

- **The fail-soft reform can now SEE the `-1` sentinel family, which it was
  blind to by construction (#1008).** `tools/failsoft_classify_check.sh`
  enumerated `return make_num(0)` and `return make_str("")`, so its population
  was defined by the stand-in VALUE — and a builtin laundering to a different
  sentinel was invisible to it however carefully it was run. Executed on the
  parent, with the flag ON:

  ```
  EIGS_STRICT=1  list_contains of [42, 1]  -> raises   (converted by #971)
  EIGS_STRICT=1  index_of of [42, "x"]     -> -1       (silent, four lines away)
  EIGS_STRICT=1  ord of 42                 -> -1       (silent)
  ```

  Widening the matcher to `-1` surfaced **22 further sites across 6 builtins in
  3 files**, ten of them genuine argument guards that had never been counted.
  **And the widening falsified an exemption written for the narrower
  population, which is the lesson worth keeping.** This gate's header said a
  soft return reached through a HELPER was outside it and that *"nothing in
  this surface does that today"* — true while the population was `0`/`""`, and
  false the moment `-1` joined it. `exec_capture` had three argument guards
  spelled `return exec_capture_result(-1, "")`, in the same file this change
  edits, ~240 lines from a site it did convert, and a text matcher cannot see
  one of them. They were found by `strict_differential.sh --sweep`, which
  probes BEHAVIOUR and so has no such blind spot — `QUIET exec_capture ->
  [-1, ""]` under strict — and are converted now, along with a fourth spelling
  the matcher also cannot enumerate (`return make_num(off > 0 ? off : -1)`,
  where the sentinel is a ternary arm). When this matcher grows, every
  "nothing does that" claim in its header has to be re-read against the new
  population: they are assertions, not disclaimers.
  All 124 previously-classified sites were still found — a sequential matcher
  is not monotone in coverage, so that check runs whenever this population
  grows.
  `index_of`, `ord` and `list_index_of` now raise under `EIGS_STRICT=1` for a
  wrong-typed argument and are byte-identical with the flag off. `ord`'s guard
  was **one condition carrying two verdicts** — a non-string (a mistake) OR an
  empty string (the documented `-1`) — and is split, by the same rule #1008
  itself applied to `sum`/`mean`/`norm`; tagging it either way would have
  permanently blessed the other half. `index_of`'s `-1` for non-string operands
  is a deliberate #316 decision (folding to `""` gave a false positive at index
  0), which is exactly the shape `ARG_GUARD` fits: the answer is preserved with
  the flag off, the mistake is loud with it on.
  `proc_write`, `proc_wait` and `eigen_eval_loss` are classified through the
  same pass. `eigen_eval_loss` is a GRADER — a laundered `-1` loss is
  indistinguishable from a real score, the exact failure #975 exists to stop —
  so its three argument checks raise under strict while its `stderr` line and
  its non-strict answer are unchanged, guarded in place with a constant
  condition so control flow is provably identical.
  Three new answer-pins hold the documented misses quiet: `index_of` finding
  nothing, `list_index_of` finding nothing, and `ord` of the empty string.
  The gate's self-test gained the two cases that witness the new branch — an
  unmarked `-1` must be caught, and a *classified* `-1` must be clean — because
  a branch with no fixture where it is the sole evidence is untested however
  many fixtures exist. 13/13.
  `tools/strict_differential.sh` now derives its variant-only file set from
  `make print-SRC_V_release` instead of a hard-coded `ext_*.c` list, which had
  missed `model_infer.c` entirely (`eigen_eval_loss` reported as "raised by the
  wrong guard: undefined variable" in a default build).
  Differential against a build of the parent commit: **68/68 identical with the
  flag off, 0 differing, 0 waivers needed**, 68/68 raising under strict, 18/18
  answer-pins held, 64/64 valid-input rows unchanged in both modes.
  **Still outside the population, and stated rather than implied:** the
  builtins that launder through a FALSY path rather than a sentinel —
  `file_exists`, `is_dir`, `read_text`, `env_get` answer `0`/`""` for a
  wrong-typed path, so a type mistake reads as "not there". Those returns are
  in the population and correctly tagged `fs:ANSWER`, because the value IS the
  documented answer; what is missing is any way to tell it from a rejected
  argument. That needs a decision on #1008, not a wider matcher.

- **`gfx_open`, `audio_open` and `audio_capture_open` no longer reinterpret a
  string as a number and report success (#1007).** `Value`'s union overlaps
  `double num` with `char *str`, and all three read `.data.num` with no type
  check — while a sibling argument on the very next line, and
  `audio_stream_open` 180 lines away, *were* checked. So a string where a
  number belonged reinterpreted a pointer as a double and `(int)`-cast it. In
  practice a pointer's bit pattern is a tiny denormal, so it read as **0** and
  the call answered as though it had worked:

  | | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | `gfx_open of ["800", "600", "t"]` | `1` — a 0×0 window | `0`, and raises under strict |
  | `audio_open of ["44100", "1"]` | `2` — a device id | `0`, and raises under strict |
  | `audio_capture_open of ["44100", "1"]` | `3` — a device id | `0`, and raises under strict |

  The bogus audio opens took the real device with them, so the *next*
  well-typed `audio_open` in the same program answered 0.
  `audio_capture_open` is not one of the two sites #1007 names — it was found
  by grepping for the shape instead of working the issue's list, and of the
  three audio `*_open` builtins only `audio_stream_open` had the guard.
  A fourth site, `audio_stream_open`, never type-punned — its checks are part
  of the condition — but reached the same silent success by another route: a
  wrong-typed pair simply SKIPPED the override, opened at the 44100/1 defaults
  and answered a real device id, so a caller asking for 48000 was told it got
  what it asked for. It is guarded now too.
  **And a worse shape than the rest: pointer disclosure.** Seven builtins —
  `audio_sine`, `audio_saw`, `audio_square`, `audio_sweep`, `audio_noise`,
  `audio_envelope` and `audio_gain` — BUILD their returned data out of the same
  unchecked reads, so the pun did not merely mis-draw: it copied a
  reinterpreted `char *` into a list the script reads back. Executed on the
  parent binary, `audio_sweep of ["100", 200, 0.01, 0.5, 0]` returned 441
  samples whose first element was `3.62e-314`, `3.44e-314`, `3.71e-314` on
  three consecutive runs — an ASLR pointer value, handed to the program, fresh
  each run. All seven are guarded, and their assertions run on a machine with
  no libSDL2 (they touch no SDL at all), which is the part of this change CI
  exercises most directly.
  **That per-run freshness is now the gate, and it needed no name list.** New
  suite section **[134]** runs each probe TWICE and diffs: a stable answer is
  fine whatever it is, a differing one means address-space state reached the
  program. It matters that the list was DERIVED that way rather than read —
  writing the fix from the six generators left `audio_gain` unguarded, and only
  the sweep found it. The section carries a positive control (a genuinely
  nondeterministic expression that MUST be reported as differing), because with
  every site fixed "nothing differs" is also what an empty probe list prints.
  **And the probe SPELLING is part of the mechanism, which cost a round to
  learn.** Two rows punned an argument that structurally cannot leak, so they
  passed against a binary with the guard deleted: `audio_square`'s `freq`
  makes the phase never advance, so every sample is `+amp` exactly and the
  output is identical run to run; `audio_envelope`'s `attack`/`decay`/`release`
  only feed `(int)(x * rate)`, which casts the denormal to 0. Only the
  argument that reaches the RETURNED data discloses — amplitude, and
  `sustain` with a list long enough to have a sustain region. Every row is now
  verified DIFFER against a build of the parent commit, and a mutant with two
  guards deleted fails naming exactly those two.
  Measured: the section passes on this build; on the parent it fails naming
  all seven; on the two-guard mutant it fails naming exactly those two.
  Separately, `audio_convert_samples` **coerced** a non-number element to 0, so
  a wrong-typed sample list built a valid buffer of silence and the caller's
  `if (!buf)` guard never saw it — `audio_play of ["a", "b", "c"]` returned a
  real channel id and played nothing. Coercion is the one shape that cannot be
  caught downstream, so it is rejected at the element. The REJECTION is
  unconditional (the caller then answers 0, which is what BUILTINS.md already
  documents for `audio_play` and what the coercing version could never
  produce); the RAISE is strict-only, exactly as `ARG_GUARD` behaves. A first
  draft raised unconditionally and turned a call that used to return a channel
  id into a fatal error in the default build — the one thing the #971 reform
  promises not to do, and `lib/audio.eigs` passes user data straight through.
  **`audio_capture_open`'s guard sits ABOVE its `TRACE_NONDET_TAKE`**, and the
  placement is load-bearing. Below it, the guard returned before
  `TRACE_NONDET_RECORD` and the capture run wrote NO record — while the replay
  run's `TAKE` ran first and CONSUMED one, breaking `trace.h`'s "exactly one
  record per call either way" contract: every later record for that name
  shifted by one, and the rejected call replayed as a real device id, silently,
  even under `EIGS_STRICT=1`. Measured: capture printed `0 2 null`, replay of
  that same tape printed `2 2 null`. An argument's type is deterministic, so a
  rejected call is not a nondeterministic input and must not touch the tape.
  Section [133] gained a third pass that captures and replays the same program
  and requires the two outputs to be identical — no other pass runs under
  `EIGS_TRACE`/`EIGS_REPLAY`, which is why the first version got this wrong.
  All three guards sit **ahead of the SDL load**, which is what makes them
  reachable on a machine with no libSDL2 — the CI runners have none, so a
  guard placed after the load would never be exercised there.
  Before this change `grep -c rt_error src/ext_gfx.c` was **0**: the one
  builtin surface in the repo where a caller mistake had no loud outcome
  available, and the surface all 18 `lib/ui*.eigs` modules and the whole app
  fleet sit on.
  **The guard-order rule is now a gate, because CI had to teach it.** Three
  guards were deliberately hoisted above the SDL load and the fourth,
  `audio_stream_open`, was not. That difference is invisible on a machine WITH
  libSDL2 — the guard is reached and raises — so every local suite passed, and
  the CI extensions lane, which has none, failed with exactly one row:
  `#1007 strict: audio_stream_open raises on string freq/channels — expected
  type_mismatch, got none`. A guard behind an environment check does not exist
  in the environment that lacks it. `tools/gfx_guard_order_check.sh` now
  asserts every `ARG_GUARD` in `ext_gfx.c` precedes its own SDL load, with a
  floor so a deleted guard is a failure rather than a smaller clean scan; it is
  suite section **[135]** and is deliberately NOT probe-gated, since it scans
  source and so runs in the lanes where [133]/[134] skip. It needed comment and
  string stripping on its first run: the explanatory comment above the guard
  mentions `load_sdl2()`, and the scanner read its own prose as code.

  **Residual, stated so a green suite is not misread as coverage of #1007:**
  roughly **89 unchecked `items[N]->data.num` reads remain in `ext_gfx.c`**,
  along with the ~52 `make_null()` drawing returns where `gfx_rect`/`gfx_line`/
  `gfx_text` answer a wrong-typed argument by silently drawing nothing. This
  change closes the sites that report SUCCESS or disclose a pointer; the rest
  stay open on #1007. `tools/failsoft_classify_check.sh` still cannot see the
  `make_null()` population at all — it enumerates only `0`/`""`. And
  `make asan-gfx` is not yet wired into any suite section or CI job: running it
  over the gfx corpus surfaces pre-existing arena and SDL-internal leaks that
  need triage first, so it ships as a tool, not as a gate.
  New suite section **[133]**, two passes. The strict pass is the load-bearing
  half: the non-strict stand-in for these guards is `0`, which is *also* what
  all three answer when libSDL2 is simply absent, so a "wrong types give 0"
  assertion passes on unfixed code in that environment. Measured on the
  unfixed binary here: 3 rows red in each pass.
  New `make asan-gfx` target — the same structural gap `asan-http` closed for
  `ext_http`, one surface over. `make asan` compiles `ext_gfx.c` out, so until
  now no sanitizer build anywhere, local or CI, ever instrumented it. SDL is
  `dlopen`'d rather than linked, so it builds on a machine without libSDL2.
  `tools/strict_differential.sh` learned about variant-only builds: a guard in
  `ext_gfx.c` cannot be probed by a default binary, so probes for a builtin
  this build does not contain are **skipped and counted by name** rather than
  scored as a silent guard. Presence is decided by RUNNING the name, not by
  reading `--api` — `--api` reports the documented surface, not the linked one
  (a release binary lists `extension gfx gfx_open` while `gfx_open` is an
  undefined variable at runtime).

- **A rejected `store_update` no longer destroys the record it was updating
  (#1006).** `store_update` is delete-then-put, and it discarded the put's
  result. `store_put` has genuine failure returns — "record too large",
  "record exceeds page size", a page read that fails mid-scan — and on any of
  them the old record had *already* been deleted, nothing was re-inserted, and
  the row was simply gone. Growing a record past the 4089-byte page limit
  silently destroyed it; a later `store_get` found nothing.
  The delete half is split into `store_locate` (find the record) and
  `store_tombstone` (mark it deleted), which is what makes the half-finished
  replace undoable: deletion is a tombstone that never touches the JSON body,
  so `store_untombstone` rebuilds the header from the key text plus the two
  lengths the locate captured and the record comes back **byte-for-byte** —
  the whole `.db` file is unchanged after a rejected update, which is what the
  regression test asserts. `store_delete` now shares those primitives rather
  than carrying its own copy of the scan.
  Two smaller holes in the same function closed with it: a non-dict record is
  rejected *before* anything is removed (it used to be caught by `store_put`,
  after the delete), and a `store_put` failure that raises nothing now raises
  rather than being reported as an ordinary "no row updated" 0. The record
  check sits deliberately *after* the locate, not before it, so that an absent
  key with a bad record still answers a silent 0 exactly as it did — checking
  earlier would have raised on an argument shape that used to be quiet, which
  is a behaviour change with the strict flag off.
  The check that catches the failure tests `put_result->type != VAL_STR`, not
  `!put_result`: `store_put` signals failure with `make_null()` — a Value *of
  type* null — so the obvious C-NULL test is true on no path it can take, and
  the first draft of this fix shipped exactly that vacuous guard until the
  repro caught it.
  **`store_put` itself reported success after a failed page write** — it
  discarded `store_write_page`'s result on both of its writing paths and
  answered with the key regardless. That is the same defect one layer down,
  and `store_update` now depends on that answer, so it is fixed here too.
  It has no reachable oracle, so it is validated by fault injection instead:
  with the write forced to fail for the replacement record only, the old code
  answers `store_update -> 1` with the record gone, and the new code raises
  `io` and reads the record back intact.
  Validated by five planted faults on the restore path, each caught by its own
  assertion: the vacuous `!put_result` check, a skipped restore, a gutted
  `store_untombstone`, a restore that rebuilds the key but not `json_len`, and
  a removed non-dict check. The regression test's byte-identity assertion is
  what separates the shipped in-place restore from a plausible alternative
  that re-*appends* the old record — that alternative passes every other
  assertion in the file while growing the database on each rejected update —
  so the fingerprint carries its own self-test proving it can fail.
  `tools/strict_differential.sh` loses its `store_update` UNPROBEABLE waiver:
  the waiver's reason was that the guard was unreachable *because* store_update
  called store_delete first, and this change removes that delegation. The
  waiver named its own trigger ("if it is ever made reachable it must gain a
  probe here"); it now has two probes instead. Differential against a build of
  the parent commit: **63/63 identical with the flag off**, 63/63 raising under
  strict, 15/15 answer-pins held.

- **A name first bound in a `for` body now escapes the loop, like every other
  block form (#959).** `is` is documented as outward-mutable — a name not
  found in any enclosing scope creates a binding there, with `local` as the
  opt-in for an inner one — but the create path used the *starting* env,
  which inside a `for` body is the per-iteration loop env, so the binding died
  with the iteration. Measured across all six combinations, module-level
  `for` was the ONLY one that did not escape:

  | | module level | inside a function |
  |---|---|---|
  | `if` | escapes | escapes |
  | `loop while` | escapes | escapes |
  | `for` | **did not** | escapes |

  So the same source construct meant two different things depending on
  whether it sat at module level or inside a function. `Env` gains an
  `is_loop_env` flag (set at `OP_LOOP_ENV_FRESH`, and cleared explicitly in
  `env_new` because the env freelist does not zero a recycled struct), and
  the two "not found anywhere — create it" sites — `CASE(SET_NAME)` and
  `jit_helper_set_name` — create the binding in the nearest enclosing
  non-loop scope. The JIT inlines only the IC-hit path and falls back to that
  helper, so both tiers agree by construction.
  `local` is untouched (a different opcode, still loop-local), the loop
  variable still does not escape, and nested `for` bodies reach the enclosing
  scope exactly as nested `if` blocks do. The persisted-loop-env optimisation
  is unaffected: this changes *where a first-binding is created*, not that the
  loop env is reused.
  `tests/test_scope_semantics.eigs` SS3 asserted the old behaviour and is
  migrated — it was the only caller in the corpus standing on it, and its own
  comment described the mechanism ("EigenScript's env_set creates in the local
  scope if not found in parents … So loop_local is gone") rather than an
  intent. Downstream, ouroboros carries a `must_reject` canary for this that
  fires at the next `EIGS_REF` bump; the case folds back into
  `test/programs/module_name_in_block.eigs` there.

- **Default parameter values now fire wherever a function is ENTERED, not only
  at a call site (#997).** Defaults are not applied by the caller — they are
  bytecode in the callee's own prologue (`OP_DEFAULT_PARAM`), and the VM skips
  a slot's default exactly when `slot < frame->call_argc`. Every non-call entry
  built its frame with `call_argc = chunk->param_count`, i.e. "every slot was
  supplied", so no default could ever fire on those paths: `d of 1` on
  `define d(a, b is 3)` gives `[1, 3]`, but `spawn of [d, 1]` gave `[1, null]`,
  and so did `task_spawn` and a `sort_by` key reached with one element. A
  defaulted parameter silently arrived as `null` inside a worker — the body saw
  a value it was written never to see, with nothing raised.
  All FOUR non-call entries into a bytecode function now state the argc they
  actually supplied (`vm_execute_argc`), with a re-collected single slot
  counting as one argument. The fourth — `builtin_dispatch`, the C fallback
  for `dispatch` — was missed on the first cut and found by enumerating the
  entry set mechanically (`grep -rn "body_count == -1" src/*.c`) rather than
  from memory. It matters more than its name suggests: the compiler picks
  between the compiled `OP_DISPATCH` and this fallback, and falls back
  whenever the compilation unit merely MENTIONS `eval` (#459), so an
  unrelated `eval` reference elsewhere in a file silently changed parameter
  binding — `dispatch of argv` gave `[1, null]` where the literal form and a
  direct `d of 1` both gave `[1, 3]`. The opposite error is worse than the bug and is tested for
  explicitly: an argc that is too LOW would fire a default *over* an explicit
  argument, so `spawn of [d, 1, 9]` binding `[1, 9]` is pinned alongside.
  `vm_execute` keeps its old contract for module-level and handler entries,
  which genuinely do bind every slot.

- **The doc-example gate could not see indented or blockquoted fences, so those
  examples were silently unchecked (#946).** The fence pattern matched only at
  column zero, and the closing scan used `startswith("```")` — so a fenced
  block that was indented, or nested in a blockquote or list item, was invisible
  to the gate. Such a block is valid CommonMark and renders normally on GitHub,
  so a document could read as fully gated while part of it was never run, never
  compared, and never mentioned. Measured: a synthetic document with one plain
  and two nested examples reported `1 checked, exit 0` before and now catches
  both nested ones. On real files the parser goes from **0 to 4** recognised
  examples in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` and **0 to 1** in
  `docs/LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md` — stated as parser CAPABILITY, not as realised
  coverage: neither file is passed to the gate by `run_all_tests.sh` and
  neither pairs its examples with `output` blocks, so nothing new executes in
  CI today. What changes is that an example written in those shapes can no
  longer be added and silently ignored.
  Recognising more turned out to be only half the job, and the first cut of
  this fix got the other half wrong in an instructive way: it handled
  indentation and blockquotes but not **list items**, and a list-item fence
  then *desynchronised* the walk — its closing fence was read as an opening
  one, every later info string shifted by one, and a plain top-level example
  that the old parser checked was silently dropped. Coverage went DOWN while
  the gate still printed `exit 0`. The reporter that was supposed to prevent
  exactly that could not fire either, because it was built from the same
  character class as the strict matcher and so was blind to precisely the
  shapes the strict matcher could not open — a cross-check must be looser on
  every axis it polices, and that one was looser on none.
  The parser now handles indentation, blockquotes (nested), list items
  (`-`/`*`/`+`/`1.`), tilde fences, and fences of more than three backticks;
  the reporter is derived independently; and an **unterminated** fence is
  reported rather than swallowing the rest of the document. All thirteen
  shapes probed are recognised, zero silently dropped, and a sweep of all 36
  markdown files in the repo produces no false alarms.
  The dedent strips only the prefix the fence itself carried, because
  EigenScript is indentation-sensitive and over-stripping silently rewrites the
  program under test — a first-line-only assertion certified exactly that fault
  when it was planted, so the self-test compares whole bodies. `--selftest`
  pins fourteen cases including a negative control (prose that merely mentions
  a fence mid-line is not a fence) and two that drive `main()` itself, because
  a mutant that reported an unreadable fence but no longer FAILED on it
  survived every other case. The suite pins that count.

- **Over-arity through a *callback* now raises, closing the third entry point
  into a user function (#989).** #974 made `two of [1, 2, 99]` raise at
  `CASE(CALL)` and in `jit_helper_call`, but a user function can also be
  entered from C, and those paths still bound `min(param_count, argc)` and
  discarded the surplus in silence. The issue reported `sort_by`; the actual
  population was three — `call_eigs_fn` (`sort_by`'s key function,
  `must_not_yield`, the gradient helpers), `spawn`, and `task_spawn` — so a
  2-parameter key over 3-wide elements sorted on a silently truncated key, and
  `spawn of [fn, 1, 2, 3]` dropped the third argument inside the worker. All
  three now raise the same catchable `value` error with the same message, so a
  callback and a direct call are indistinguishable to the program. For `spawn`
  and `task_spawn` the raise happens at the **spawn site**, not in the worker:
  the mismatch is fully known before the thread or task exists, and an error
  raised on a spawned thread has no route back to the program that made it.
  A blind review of the first cut found the hole it had left, and closing it
  is a **behavior change worth reading twice**: the over-arity guard exempts
  arity-1 callees (correctly — they re-collect), but `thread_entry` and
  `task_start` did not actually re-collect. They bound `args[0]` and dropped
  the rest, a contract `tests/test_spawn_args.eigs` recorded as *"Overfill:
  extra args ignored"*. So `spawn of [one, 5, 6]` returned `5` where
  `one of [5, 6]` gives `[5, 6]`. Once over-arity raised on 2+-param callees,
  that was the last place an argument passed to a spawned function could
  vanish in silence. Both sites now **re-collect**, matching the oracle; the
  only caller in the corpus relying on the drop was that contract test, which
  is migrated in the same change — exactly the migration #974 made for the
  same reason. Consumers pin releases, so this surfaces at the next bump.
  A third blind round found the remaining cell: a **non-list** element
  reaching a 2+-parameter key bound *nothing* — every parameter read `null`,
  so `sort_by of [[3, 1, 2], keyfn]` with a 2-parameter key gave every element
  key `0` and returned the list **unsorted**, rc 0, no diagnostic. The oracle
  treats one scalar as a 1-argument call (`a = 3, b = null`), which is what it
  now does; a *list* element still spreads, which is the record destructuring
  `sort_by` exists for. Under-arity on the callback path also null-fills
  explicitly rather than leaving the tail unbound — an unbound name resolves
  through the CLOSURE, so a 2-parameter key over 1-wide elements could
  silently read an outer variable of the same name instead of `null`.
  `sort_by` additionally stopped masking the cause — it inspected the returned
  value and reported "key function must return a number" *on top of* whatever
  the key function had actually raised. The arity-1 re-collect carve-out is
  preserved through the callback path (a 1-parameter key still receives the
  whole element), and under-arity is unchanged.

- **A child `.sh` test that dies no longer reports a passing section (#988).**
  The suite's ~45 child scripts run as `FOO=$(bash "$TESTS_DIR/test_foo.sh")`,
  and a command substitution keeps the child's stdout while **discarding its
  exit status** — so the section's verdict came from `grep -c "FAIL:"` alone.
  A child that printed two `PASS:` lines and then segfaulted reported a
  passing section; a child that did not exist at all reported
  `0/0 passed, 0 failed`, also a pass. Reproduced at exit 139, 127 and 1. This
  is the same disease `rc_ok` fixed for `.eigs` programs ("marker-grep alone
  used to let a crash *after* correct output pass"), left standing on the
  `.sh` half. Fixed centrally rather than at 45 call sites — a `bash` wrapper
  function emits a synthetic `FAIL:` line into the child's own captured output
  (so every existing site's marker logic fails the section with no site edit)
  and records the child in a ledger reported at `[99p]`. `tools/child_exit_check.sh`
  is the drift gate (population floor, bypass-spelling check, 6 planted faults
  + a clean control) and `tests/test_child_exit.sh` proves the mechanism
  actually fails a section for each of the three modes. Measured on `main`
  before the fix: all 50 child invocations exited 0, so this closed a latent
  hazard rather than an active cover-up.

- **The suite's own vacuity rule no longer cries wolf on a deliberate skip.**
  The first cut of #988's zero-check half failed any `test_*.sh` child that
  exited 0 without printing a `PASS:`/`FAIL:` marker. Ten children have
  twenty-two legitimate skip paths — no `python3`, no `git`, no `curl`, and
  **sanitizer build** — and the dev box has every one of those tools, so a
  local 3976/3976 said nothing about them and four CI lanes went red on
  children behaving exactly as designed. An explicit `SKIP:` now counts as
  reporting: the disease is *silence*, not *skipping*. `[99p]` also stopped
  describing a vacuous child as having "exited nonzero" — it exited 0.

- **The bench gate's Valgrind install can no longer burn the job cap and
  report as a red gate (#987).** `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install
  -y valgrind` had no timeout, retry, or fallback; a stalled mirror hung until
  the job's `timeout-minutes: 30` killed it. A timed-out job's conclusion is
  `cancelled`, which `gh pr checks` renders as **fail** — so an instrument
  that never ran presented identically to a detected regression, on the one
  gate whose entire purpose is to answer "did this change cost instructions?".
  Observed twice in a row on PR #985 while the other 17 checks passed. The
  step now retries three times behind per-command timeouts under a 10-minute
  step cap, verifies `valgrind --version` actually runs, and fails with an
  explicit `SETUP FAILURE` message distinguishing it from a gate verdict. The
  identical unguarded step in the `valgrind (memcheck smoke)` job — which the
  issue did not mention — was fixed with it.

- **`eigen_generate` now rides the trace tape, and the `randn` tensor fills
  draw from the seedable stream (#960).** Sampled generation carried no
  `TRACE_NONDET` record, so a program generating at temperature > 0 could not
  be replayed from its tape — violating the no-untraced-nondeterminism rule the
  whole `EIGS_TRACE`/`EIGS_REPLAY` substrate rests on. The emitted token list is
  now one `N eigen_generate=` record per call (not one per sampled position: the
  draws are an implementation detail of the decoding policy, the list is what
  the script observes), taken back *before* the model is consulted — a recorded
  generation replays with no checkpoint on disk and no RNG draw, the boundary
  the `net_*` family already holds; every return is recorded, argument errors
  and the no-model-loaded empty list included, so a program that hits one cannot
  desync the stream. Separately, `random_normal`'s Box-Muller fill still called
  libc `rand()`, unpinnable from script; it now draws from the same `drand48`
  stream as `random`/`random_int`, so `seed_random of N` makes a randn tensor
  reproducible. Both were residuals of the v0.40.0 sampler-seedability fix.

- **A long `elif` chain no longer exhausts the parser's C stack (#926).** Each
  arm desugars to a nested `if` by recursing in `parse_statement`, so the
  parser now charges the shared depth budget before descending and drains the
  unread tail when that bound is reached. Chains that cross the shared budget
  now receive a bounded parse diagnostic (including `--lint`) instead of a
  stack crash or noisy cascade; the deliberate arm-depth charge also means
  the diagnostic changes from the compiler-depth error to a parse-depth error
  from around the 253-arm boundary.

- **`sandbox_run` descriptor graphs are bounded, and host constants are
  isolated per run (#991); per-run interned descriptor names are released
  (#1010).** A hostile or runaway descriptor can no longer amplify through
  shared constants or accumulate interned names across runs.

- **`eigen_generate` output is recorded on the trace tape and `random_normal`
  is seeded (#992)** — programs using either now replay byte-identically.

- **The sanitizer-verdict plumbing is one mutation-proven classifier
  (#968/#969/#980/#981/#983)**: a hard diagnostic (UAF, UBSan) riding along
  with a leak report no longer counts as a tolerated leak, and benign
  default-option LSan summaries no longer read as hard errors.

- **Gate hardening: the VM operand-width gate's population is floored so it
  cannot shrink quietly (#982/#984), and `strict_differential`'s divergence
  waivers have a lifecycle — a waiver that stops firing fails the gate
  instead of silently covering something new (#1016).

### Documentation

- **The README's observer showcase did not compile (#949).** The example the
  language is arguably *about* — the five interrogatives on a `signal` — was
  written as bare statements, which the compiler refuses: an interrogative's
  result would be discarded, so `what is signal` as a statement raises
  *"'what is ...' is an interrogative, not an assignment"*. A reader copying
  it into a `.eigs` file got four compile errors and no hint why. It was not
  wrong syntax — it was a **REPL session**, where a bare interrogative
  displays its answer, and nothing said so.
  Every value it claimed is correct (verified: `15`, `signal`, `3`,
  `0.3372900666170139`, `-0.016069268404407477`), so the fix is presentation:
  it now shows the REPL transcript it actually is, and is followed by a
  **checked** script-form example using `print of (what is signal)`, with a
  sentence on why the bare form is refused in a script.
  The opening tour example is now checked too. The README goes from **1
  checked example to 3**, and the doc gate from 82 to 84 — the block that had
  been broken was one of the seven the gate could not see, which is the
  coverage half of #946.

- **`sandbox_run`'s `max_iterations` is bounded by TWO counters with different
  scopes, and the doc described only one (#948).** `docs/BUILTINS.md` said
  "Loops are capped at `max_iterations`", which reads as a per-loop cap. Since
  #940 the bound is really: the compiler-emitted cap check
  (`OP_LOOP_CAP_CHECK`), which is **per call frame** and exits the loop
  gracefully as a *partial run*; and the back-edge counter (`OP_JUMP_BACK`),
  which is a **cumulative total for the whole `sandbox_run`** and raises. The
  back-edge counter is deliberately not restored per frame — otherwise an
  assembled chunk could reset its own DoS budget by calling a function — so
  the same loop called twice within one run can trip it even though each call
  is individually well inside `max_iterations`. The doc now says that; the
  behaviour is unchanged.
  `tests/test_sandbox_backedge_cap.eigs` gains section 6 pinning the crossing:
  one call trips the per-frame cap check and reports a partial run, two calls
  trip the cumulative back-edge budget and raise. Both directions are
  asserted, so neither can pass merely because the two messages coincide.
  Section 3 already covered the flat-module case; the cross-frame case was the
  gap.
  **Open, and deliberately not decided here:** whether the `1000000` default is
  still right now that it is cumulative across a run rather than per frame — a
  sandboxed workload doing 1M total iterations across many loops now trips
  where it previously would not. Left on the issue.

## [0.40.0] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **The `sandbox_run` allocation budget now charges every amplifying allocator
  class, at the growth chokepoints.** #292 charged only the size-controlled
  builtins (zeros/fill/buffer/range), leaving a family of output-proportional
  allocators uncharged: a two-line, fully in-vocab generated program
  (`s is s + s`, or the same doubling through `join`/`str_replace`/
  `text_builder`/`split`/`json_decode`/`matmul`/`buf_from_list`) blew past
  `max_bytes` to an uncatchable `x_oom` abort() — killing the grading PROCESS
  instead of failing the run (a fuller audit found each class in turn; iLambdaAi
  grader-hardening rounds, 2026-08-17). The charge now lives at the allocator
  CHOKEPOINTS rather than per-builtin: the VM's ADD string path, `strbuf_reserve`
  (json_encode/regex_replace/value_to_string, with poison-on-refusal),
  `text_builder_reserve`, `make_list`/list-growth and `make_dict`/dict-growth
  (charged at birth, so nested `<=8`-element containers cannot bypass), the
  buffer/tensor allocators (`make_shaped_buffer`/`make_buffer_like` — the
  matmul outer-product waiver was false), and `split`'s counted output.
  Refusal raises a catchable `EK_SANDBOX`; all paths are a no-op outside an
  armed sandbox. `sandbox_charge` is NULL-guarded so the non-VM entry points
  that share these utilities (`--fmt`, `--lint`, `--api`, the lexer) do not
  dereference an absent state. Residual: the pure string transforms
  (str_lower/upper/trim/substr/json_raw/str_from_bytes) bypass under
  loop-aggregation of a reused input, and the intern pool accumulates across
  runs — tracked in #964/#965.

- **`sandbox_run` now reports a cap-truncated run as NOT ok.** The loop
  budget's compiler-emitted cap checks exited the loop gracefully and let the
  program continue to a clean exit, so `sandbox_run` returned
  `{ok: 1, result: ...}` for programs whose loops were silently cut — wrong
  partial results indistinguishable from a clean run, and an infinite loop
  graded "runs cleanly" by iLambdaAi's validation ladder (found by its grader
  review, 2026-08-17; the assembled-chunk back-edge path already raised, #940).
  A per-state `sandbox_cap_hit` flag is set at every cap-trip site and
  surfaced as a structured `{kind: "sandbox", message: "loop budget exhausted
  (max_iterations=N): partial run"}` error; in-budget runs are unchanged.
  Loop-cap semantics OUTSIDE the sandbox are untouched (#772: the cap only
  arms inside `sandbox_run`).

- **`eigen_generate`'s temperature sampling now draws from the script-seedable
  RNG.** It used libc `rand()`, which `main()` seeds with `time(NULL)`, so
  `seed_random` could not pin it and two identical eval runs sampled different
  tokens — iLambdaAi's checkpoint-selection gate was ranking models on
  run-to-run noise (±3% parse rate at n=300, found by an eval-determinism
  probe 2026-08-17). Sampling now uses the shared drand48 stream behind
  `random`/`random_int` (`eigs_ensure_random_seeded()` exported from
  builtins.c): unseeded behavior stays time-random; after `seed_random of N`
  generation is reproducible. Residual: `eigen_generate` still bypasses the
  trace tape (nondeterministic output with no `TRACE_NONDET` record), and the
  `randn`-style tensor fills in builtins_tensor.c still use raw `rand()` —
  both tracked in #960.

### Security

- **An assembled chunk could pass the verifier and then corrupt the heap.**
  Reported against `sandbox_run` — the advertised containment boundary for
  untrusted bytecode. `chunk_verify` checked opcodes, operand bounds, jump
  targets and the terminator, but nothing about operand-stack depth, and the
  interpreter's fast paths index `g_vm.stack[sp - 1]` / `[sp - 2]` directly
  instead of going through the guarded `vm_pop()`. A two-byte chunk was enough:

  ```eigenscript
  ABI is 1
  desc is [ABI, [4, 40], []]           # [OP_ADD, OP_RETURN]
  r is sandbox_run of [desc, 1000]     # "double free or corruption (out)", SIGABRT
  ```

  Under ASan that is a heap-buffer-overflow READ 8 bytes before the calloc'd
  `EigsSlot[65536]` VM stack, and the num-reuse arms *write* there. 37 opcodes
  reached it — arithmetic, bitwise, comparison, the conditional jumps,
  `POP`/`DUP`/`DUP2`, `INDEX_GET`/`INDEX_SET`, the `SET_*` family, `DISPATCH`,
  `SLICE_GET`, `DESTRUCTURE_UNPACK`, the observer opcodes.

  `chunk_verify` gained a **stack-height pass**: abstract interpretation over
  the control-flow graph the earlier passes validated, from entry at height 0,
  rejecting any chunk that reaches an instruction with fewer operands than it
  consumes. Heights must agree on every incoming edge (the JVM/Wasm rule), which
  keeps verification linear — a hostile chunk cannot make the *verifier* the
  denial of service. Bounds-checking ~90 direct stack accesses in the hottest
  loop in the runtime was the alternative; the height is a static property of
  the code, so it is settled once at the gate and the fast paths keep their
  invariant for free.

  **The opcodes that pop through the guarded `vm_pop()` are not exempt**, though
  they look it. `vm_pop`'s guard is `sp <= 0` — the bottom of the whole VM
  stack, not the bottom of the running frame's window. A chunk run from inside a
  host expression has a frame base above 0, so an under-fed `DIV` there takes the
  *caller's* operand, hands it to the chunk, and decrefs it on the way out,
  freeing a value the host is still using. `OP_LIST`/`OP_DICT` clamp their base
  against the same wrong floor. Only `OP_RETURN` compares against `frame->bp`,
  and it is the only opcode the pass lets ask for nothing.

  Two hand-written test descriptors were relying on that underflow and are
  corrected to what the compiler emits (`GET_NAME` before `INTERROGATE_NAMED`,
  which consumes its operand); the `OP_DICT` oversized-count case now asserts
  refusal instead of the runtime clamp it used to check.

- **`OP_LOOP_ENV_END` with no matching `OP_LOOP_ENV_FRESH` was a
  use-after-free.** Same "the verifier cannot see it" theme, different
  mechanism: the unmatched `END` walked the frame off the end of its env chain,
  decref'ing an env the frame only *borrowed* (`owns_env == 0`) and then
  dereferencing a NULL parent — SIGSEGV on release, use-after-free in
  `env_decref` under ASan, and it handed the chunk the enclosing scope on the
  way. This one is settled at the instruction rather than at the gate, because
  it cannot be settled statically: an error unwinding into a `catch` restores
  the stack pointer but not `frame->env`, so the live env depth at a handler is
  not a property of the code. The VM now refuses an `END` when the frame is
  already at the env it was entered with (`env == fn_env`) and raises a
  catchable `loop-env underflow` — one pointer compare per loop iteration, off
  the arithmetic fast path.

- **The verifier's stack-effect table is now gated against drift.** It models
  ~90 opcodes and fails silently in both directions — too strict refuses
  legitimate bytecode from an external producer (`ouroboros`' self-hosted
  codegen), too lax reopens the hole. `run_all_tests.sh` exports
  `EIGS_VERIFY_SELF=1`, which holds the C compiler's *own* output to the same
  verifier over every program the suite runs, for one `O(code_len)` walk per
  compile; a wrong row fails at the first program that emits that opcode, naming
  the chunk and the offset. The table is an exhaustive switch with no `default`
  arm, so a *new* opcode is a build error there (#737) rather than an
  unmodelled one. `tests/test_chunk_verify_stack.eigs` sweeps every byte value
  0-255 as a minimal chunk at three stack depths — deliberately blind to the
  opcode table, so an opcode added later is covered the day it lands.

- **An assembled bare back edge crossed no loop cap — `sandbox_run`'s loop
  budget was a promise only compiler output kept.** The documented contract is
  that loops under `sandbox_run` are capped so untrusted code cannot hang, but
  the cap was enforced at `OP_LOOP_CAP_CHECK` / `OP_LOOP_STALL_CHECK`, which
  the *compiler* emits. An assembled chunk owes nobody a cap check:

  ```eigenscript
  r is sandbox_run of [[1, [30, 3, 0, 40], []], 10]   # JUMP_BACK to itself
  ```

  spun forever at 100% CPU with `max_iterations = 10`. Denial of service only
  — the memory-safety half of this surface closed with the verifier's
  stack-height pass above.

  The budget is now enforced at the back edge itself, through a **second
  counter** charged at every `OP_JUMP_BACK` while a sandbox budget is armed
  (`g_sandbox_loop_max != 0`, which is exactly "inside `sandbox_run`"). A
  second counter, not the existing `g_loop_iterations`: a compiler-emitted
  loop crosses *both* a cap check and a back edge per iteration, so one
  shared counter would halve the documented `max_iterations`. Two counters
  against one budget, whichever trips first — compiler output trips at the
  cap check at exactly the documented max; assembled chunks trip at the back
  edge. The counter is saved and restored at the `sandbox_run` boundary only,
  never per call frame, so a chunk cannot reset its own budget by calling a
  function. And JIT compilation is now denied outright inside the sandbox —
  one `!g_sandbox_active` term on the existing gates, the same shape as the
  `!g_task_sched` / `!g_arena.active` terms already there — which removes the
  whole class of "the native tier disagrees with the interpreter's guard on
  attacker-supplied bytecode": sandboxed code runs interpreted.

  Settling it statically instead — requiring back edges to land on a cap
  check at verify time — would reject every `for` loop the compiler emits
  (their back edge targets `ITER_NEXT`), and a live loop budget is not a
  static property of the code anyway: an assembled chunk can reset the
  iterator index from the loop body.

### Fixed

- **README executable examples are now covered by the byte-for-byte doc gate
  (#934).** Only `eigenscript check` fences in the README are executed;
  illustrative snippets remain documentation, while every marked block must
  pair with the next output fence without crossing another fenced block, and
  README coverage is checked independently.

- **`--lint` no longer reports a clean file the compiler refuses (#927).** Lint
  ran the lexer, the parser and the lint walkers and stopped there, so the
  strongest defect a file can have — it does not compile — was the one thing
  lint stayed silent about:

  ```
  $ eigenscript deep.eigs
  Compile error line 2: expression nesting too deep to compile (limit 128) ...
  2 compile error(s) — aborting          # rc=1

  $ eigenscript --lint deep.eigs
  deep.eigs: no issues found             # rc=0
  ```

  Meanwhile an unused parameter exits 1. The exit code reported style and not
  compilability, and `--lint` is the CI-facing surface: a consumer repo gates
  its build on it, and the contract it reasonably infers from `rc=0` is *at
  minimum* that the file builds.

  Lint now compiles the unit and throws the bytecode away, so every
  compile-stage diagnostic — `break` outside a loop, an expression past the
  nesting limit, a constant pool past 65536, an un-encodable jump — reaches the
  lint surface as the new **`E004`** code, in both the human output and
  `--json`, and fails under either `--lint-level` the way `E002` already does.
  Compiling is not running: `import` and `load_file` are executed by the VM, so
  lint still never runs the program, and a file that does compile lints exactly
  as before.

- **The language server no longer swallows compile-stage errors (#935).** A
  document that parsed but did not compile published an empty diagnostics
  array — the editor showed no squiggle while the CLI refused the same source:

  ```
  $ eigenscript loop_free.eigs
  Compile error line 1: 'break' outside a loop
  ```

  versus `publishDiagnostics: {"diagnostics": []}` from `eigenlsp`. The
  parse-OK arm of `send_diagnostics` ran only `lint_collect`; it now also
  compiles the unit and throws the chunk away, exactly as `--lint` does for
  #927, so every compile-stage error — `break` outside a loop, an expression
  past the nesting limit, a constant pool past 65536 — reaches the editor as an
  **`E004`** squiggle on the offending line. A document that compiles cleanly
  publishes nothing new.

## [0.39.0] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **A too-deep expression now says so (#912).** `compile_node`'s depth guard was
  the one `g_parse_errors++` site in `compiler.c` that printed nothing: it
  recorded the message for an embedder and stopped there, so from a terminal the
  program died with a bare `N compile error(s) — aborting` — no line, no
  message, no caret — and `--lint` on the same file stayed clean.

  It bites through **f-strings** above all. The lexer desugars one into a `+`
  chain (~2 levels per interpolation), so an f-string past ~62 `{}` fields
  reaches the 128-level limit with nothing nested-looking in the source. That is
  reachable by accretion — a status line, a CSV row, a debug dump — and it cost
  a 15-minute bisect in a consumer repo to find, because nothing pointed at the
  statement, the file, or the concept.

  The guard now prints `Compile error line N: expression nesting too deep to
  compile (limit 128) — split the expression`, with the f-string mechanism as a
  note, **once per compile** (it trips again at every sibling of the offending
  node, and one message repeated is not more information). The
  `Bytecode loop offset too large at line N` message was the other odd one out
  and now matches the `Compile error line N:` format every other site uses.

  `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` gains the compile-error category, which it never had —
  seven messages that existed in the code and in no document.

### Fixed

- **`report of x` no longer raises "undefined variable" for a name an
  `unobserved:` block promoted to a module slot (#895).** A name assigned
  only inside such a block and never referenced outside it is promoted to a
  module frame slot. The observer call-forms that take a bare name —
  `report of x`, `report_value of x`, `trajectory of x`, `observe of x`,
  `<predicate> of x` — each choose between a `*_SLOT` and a `*_NAME` opcode,
  and each asked for the slot only inside a function (`c->enclosing`). At
  module scope they always emitted `*_NAME`, whose env lookup finds nothing
  for a promoted name, so:

  ```eigenscript
  unobserved:
      m is 9.0
      print of (report of m)     # Error: undefined variable 'm'
      print of (str of m)        # 4.5 — the same name, read fine
  ```

  Three of the five raised (`report`, `report_value`, `trajectory`);
  `observe` happened to answer the no-observation default either way, and a
  predicate raises the #871 message first. All five now resolve the slot at
  module scope exactly as the plain-read path does — only for a promoted
  name, so an ordinary module binding still takes `*_NAME`. The answers are
  the ones the same code gives when nothing is promoted: an optimization
  must not change an answer, let alone turn one into an error.

### Added

- **`<kw> is x when <n>` — the past is addressable per assignment, so a
  loop's iterations survive it (#868).** Temporal interrogatives were keyed
  by source line, and a source line is not an injective address for an
  execution: `#827`'s pruning retains only the strict suffix minima of the
  line sequence, so a loop body that assigns one name N times keeps exactly
  ONE entry. `what is x at <body line>` answered the last iteration and the
  other N-1 were unreachable — with `prev of x` reaching one further step
  back and that being the entire available depth. The interesting temporal
  question is almost always about a particular iteration or call, so the
  addressable set excluded most of what the feature is for. Line addressing
  is also edit-brittle: inserting a line above a query silently changes what
  it means, which is why `tests/test_temporal.eigs` has to be line-number
  sensitive.

  `when <n>` addresses the **nth recorded assignment** instead — 1-based, in
  execution order, injective by construction and unmoved by edits:

  ```eigenscript
  x is 0
  for i in range of 5:
      x is i * 10
  print of (what is x when 3)   # 10 — the second iteration
  print of (prev of x when 3)   # 0  — the one before it
  ```

  Every interrogative takes it (`who`/`when`/`where`/`why`/`how`, and `prev
  of x when n` = assignment `n - 1`). Additive: `at` is unchanged, and its
  answers are byte-identical.

  Retention is bounded at the same time, because per-occurrence storage is
  precisely what #827 was about. The occurrences ride a separate per-name
  **ring** — the last `EIGS_OCC_WINDOW` assignments, default 256 — so peak
  RSS stays flat across a 16x increase in iteration count. Arming is the
  narrowest of the three tiers: a ring exists only for a name some
  `when`-qualified query named at compile time, with no wildcard, so
  `state_at` / an open tape / `spawn` cannot widen it to every binding the
  way they widen the line history.

  The two empty answers are kept distinct rather than collapsed to `null`:
  an ordinal that has not happened yet is `null`, but one that has **aged out
  of the window raises**, naming the retained range and the env var. The
  runtime had that value and dropped it to stay bounded; reporting it as
  `null` would be indistinguishable from a name that was never assigned —
  a confident wrong answer instead of a missing one.

  Note the ordinal space is the history's own recorded-assignment counter,
  which disagrees with the unqualified `when is x` by the number of
  assignments made inside `unobserved:` blocks — filed as #908.

- **`math_flags` / `clear_math_flags` — the numeric clamps are no longer
  undetectable (#865).** "Finite by construction" (NaN → 0, overflow →
  ±1e308) keeps a program running, which is the point, but it kept it
  running with a *plausible* number and no way to tell. Two consequences
  the contract never mentioned: reassociation silently changes a result
  by 292 orders of magnitude — `(1e300 * 1e300) / 1e300` is `1e8`, which
  passes any sanity check a caller applies, while `1e300 * (1e300 /
  1e300)` is `1e300` — and a saturated value compares equal to itself
  under further growth, so no in-language predicate could distinguish
  "this is 1e308" from "this overflowed". NaN was worse: it collapses to
  `0`, indistinguishable from a real zero.
  The fix is IEEE-754's own answer, sticky exception flags. Arithmetic
  results are **unchanged** — the finite invariant is load-bearing for
  the JIT's bail comparison, the observer's entropy, `str of`, and the
  JSON encoders, so abandoning it is a far larger change than the defect
  warrants — but every clamp now sets a bit you can read:

  ```eigenscript
  clear_math_flags of null
  result is risky of xs
  if (math_flags of null).overflow:
      print of "a value saturated; this result is contaminated"
  ```

  Set inside `num_guard`'s existing clamp branches, so the arithmetic
  fast path is untouched and all ~54 call sites are covered at once. The
  JIT needs no mirror: it already bails to the interpreter on any result
  past `EIGS_NUM_MAX` (including ±Inf/NaN), so the interpreter's
  `num_guard` runs and the flag cannot go tier-dependent.
  String conversion is a route too, and it was the quietest case of
  all: `num of "nan"` is `0` and `num of "inf"` is `1e308`, so a data
  column containing either parsed to a plausible number with nothing to
  check. Both now set a bit.
  The audit also turned up **three more undocumented domain
  substitutions**, all of which now set `invalid`: `log of 0` returns
  `log(1e-10)` = `-23.025850929940457` (the one the issue named),
  `sqrt of -1` returns `0` — indistinguishable from `sqrt of 0` — and
  `asin`/`acos` silently clamp an out-of-range argument, so `asin of 5`
  answers `asin of 1`. Their values are unchanged; only the silence is.
  Documented in the Numbers promise, including the associativity trade,
  so it is visible rather than discovered.

- **`gfx_read` — pixel readback, the render-decode oracle primitive
  (#823).** `gfx_read of [x, y]` returns the back-buffer pixel as
  `[r, g, b]` (call after drawing, before `gfx_present`). Containment
  and rendering claims can now be proved on real pixels in-process —
  the stubbed suite cannot crop, and #599/F-DYN-12 both showed a green
  stubbed suite over a broken real render. Works under
  `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy`, so suite section [132] runs the real SDL
  software renderer in CI with no display. Renderer pixels are a
  nondeterministic input (font raster, driver), so it records/replays
  on the trace tape like `audio_stream_queued`.
- **`ui_clip_push` / `ui_clip_pop` (lib/ui_draw.eigs)** — a nesting
  clip stack over `gfx_clip`: push INTERSECTS with the current clip,
  pop restores the parent clip instead of clearing it. Exported for
  custom paint routines; every internal lib/ui clip site migrated off
  raw `gfx_clip` set/clear pairs (a child's clear used to wipe its
  parent's clip).

### Fixed

- **The UI fragments keep undefined-name protection, and the stdlib gate
  can see when they don't (#874).** All 18 `lib/ui*.eigs` fragments
  silenced `E003` wholesale with `# lint: allow-file E003`, the escape
  `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` explicitly discourages, while `# lint: loaded-by`
  — built for exactly this case — was used nowhere. That switched
  undefined-name checking off across the subtree where cold branches
  (per-widget dispatch, rarely-hit handlers) are densest, and it hid two
  real errors: `lib/ui_layout.eigs` referenced `_label_measure` and
  `_layout_dock` with no marker at all, so `--lint` exited 1 on the
  shipped stdlib at v0.38.0. Every fragment now declares
  `# lint: loaded-by ui.eigs`, which resolves sibling names from the
  composer's transitive binding set while still firing on a genuine typo
  (verified with a planted one). The `[stdlib]` suite gate grepped only
  for `Parse error line`, so it filtered out E-class findings — which
  are not style — and stayed green through all of it; it now also fails
  on any `"severity":"error"` from `--lint --json`, proved by reverting
  `ui_layout.eigs` and watching the gate go red.

- **An installed stdlib no longer shadows itself (#904).** `import`
  resolves project-first (#821), probing `<name>.eigs` before
  `lib/<name>.eigs`. But the resolver chain's tail steps are the *install
  roots* — `<prefix>/lib/eigenscript/` and `~/.local/lib/eigenscript/`,
  which is what `make install` writes — and they answer the bare
  `<name>.eigs` request just as readily as `lib/<name>.eigs`. So on any
  machine that had ever run `make install`, the installed stdlib came
  back as the *project* hit, and every stdlib import produced two defects
  at once:

  - a spurious `Warning: import 'json' matches both a project file and a
    stdlib module` on stderr, once per name — the diagnostic reporting
    the stdlib as shadowing itself;
  - a real resolution bug behind it: the installed copy **won**, over the
    stdlib shipped next to the binary actually running and over a
    bundle's own extracted `lib/`. A bundle — the one artifact of this
    project designed to be copied to a machine you don't control — quietly
    ran the host's stdlib instead of the one it carries.

  Bundle replay took the visible damage: the replayed run was byte-identical
  to the recorded one, same tape, same draw, same stdout, and failed its
  byte-identity check on the one prepended warning line.
  A resolution hit now reports *which* half of the chain answered
  (`resolve_eigenscript_file_from_ex`), and an install-root hit is the
  stdlib arm — never the project arm. Genuine project shadowing warns
  exactly as before.

  Found on a second machine, not by CI — though CI had the configuration
  the whole time. Every suite leg runs from the build tree, and the one
  leg that installs (`install-smoke`, via `install.sh`) asserted only
  that the binaries existed: `--version` imports nothing. So that runner
  sat in the broken state and reported green, while the suite was red for
  anyone who followed the README's install path first. That leg now
  imports a stdlib module, and both new suite gates simulate the install
  root through `HOME` so every leg carries the check.

- **`--pkg add` resolves the remote's default branch instead of
  fabricating `main` (#879).** `lib/pkg.eigs` hardcoded `tag is "main"`
  when no tag was given, so the clone ran
  `git clone --depth 1 --branch main` and **failed outright** on any
  repository whose default branch is `master`, `trunk` or `develop`.
  Worse, the fabricated tag was persisted into `eigs.json` *before* the
  clone was attempted — deliberately, so `add` is recoverable by
  re-running `install` — which meant the recovery path was poisoned too:
  the project was left naming a branch that does not exist, and
  `--pkg install` could never fix it.
  `PACKAGE_SPEC.md:60` already said "default branch if omitted", so an
  omitted tag now means exactly that: no `--branch`, git picks the
  remote's default, and the manifest records **no `tag` key** rather
  than a guess. The lockfile still pins the resolved commit, which is
  what makes install reproducible. One `clone_args` helper is shared by
  `add`, `install` and `update` so the three cannot drift on what "no
  tag" means. `--pkg add` now also reports which default branch it
  resolved to.

- **Memory corruption: values escaping an `arena_mark`…`arena_reset`
  scope (#873).** `promote_if_arena` copied only numbers and strings to
  the heap on store; a LIST escaping the scope became a dangling
  reference into memory the next `arena_mark` handed back out — silent
  wrong values, type confusion, and (via `append` into a heap list) a
  `free(): invalid pointer` abort, all reachable from pure EigenScript
  and invisible to ASan. Fixed at every store seam: `promote_if_arena`
  now deep-promotes lists (recursively; lists are the only
  arena-capable container), and the append / indexed-store /
  `OP_SET_LOCAL` / `set_at` / `list_insert_at` / `copy_into` paths
  promote arena values landing in heap containers (num fast paths
  heap-force under an open window). The JIT is gated off while an arena
  window is open — entry, OSR, and a deep-bail when a builtin opens one
  mid-thunk — because emitted stores don't promote; arena scopes run
  interpreted. Escaping a stored value is now *documented, safe
  behavior*: the arena reclaims only unstored intermediates.
  `tests/test_arena_escape.eigs` pins all seams under a stomp loop that
  overwrites the reclaimed region, plus an OSR-threshold hot variant.

- **[62] audio capture no longer flakes on an opened-but-silent device
  (#876).** A real capture device that opens but delivers no samples in
  the bounded poll (suspended/held source) failed two checks — and the
  section lump-counts, so the suite reported 38 failures for an
  environment condition. The delivery-dependent checks now SKIP with the
  count held constant (the file's existing no-device convention); a
  delivering device still runs every check against the real driver.

- **The freestanding profile now enforces switch exhaustiveness
  (#835).** `tools/freestanding_check.sh` was a third compile mechanism
  alongside the Makefile and `build.sh`, and neither of its hand-written
  `gcc` invocations carried `-Werror=switch` — so an unhandled
  `ASTType`/opcode case that is a hard error on every other build path
  only warned there. Both invocations are armed (verified with a planted
  enum case: `make freestanding-check` now fails on it), and the [99i]
  werror-switch gate learned to audit compile-bearing shell scripts —
  comment-stripped, through the same classifier as the Makefile dry
  runs, with the same zero-line hard failure and new selftest shapes —
  so this can't regress silently. `build.sh` stays outside the gate,
  stated honestly in the gate header: its compile lines name sources via
  `$SOURCES` variables the recognizer cannot tell from a link line.

- **The sandbox memory budget now covers the zlib codecs (#292
  follow-up).** `inflate`/`deflate` (and their `zlib_*` duals) are on
  the `sandbox_run` allowlist but charged nothing against `max_bytes`,
  so an allowlisted call allocated straight past the cap that exists to
  protect the host from untrusted code: a 9,732-byte compressed blob
  decompressed to a 10M-element list (~800 MB of `Value`s) inside a
  sandbox capped at 8 MiB — measured 853 MiB peak RSS, against 13 MiB
  for the charged `zeros` control under the same budget. The `{ok:0}`
  arrived only after the memory was already taken. Every other
  allocator makes the caller *name* a size, which is what the charge
  reads; a compressed blob names nothing and amplifies ~1000x, so the
  "bounded by loop-iteration cap × per-op size" reasoning that covers
  the remaining uncharged allocators does not hold for these. Both the
  codec's own output buffer (charged as it grows) and the list built
  from it are now charged. Behavior outside a budgeted `sandbox_run` is
  unchanged — `sandbox_charge` is a no-op there.

- **`sandbox_run` no longer blames a callable for a result it merely
  could not scan.** The boundary scan is node/depth budgeted and fails
  closed — correct — but every exhaustion was reported as `sandbox
  result contains a callable`, so a large list of plain numbers was
  attributed to a function that was never in the result. Budget
  exhaustion now reports that it could not scan the result; the literal
  claim is reserved for an actual sighting. Still refuses in both
  cases.

- **Widget drawing is contained (#823).** `render` now wraps every
  widget's draw in a clip of its own rect intersected with its
  ancestors' — `canvas` `on_paint` included, so a paint callback can no
  longer draw over surrounding chrome (dynamics F-DYN-12 clipped
  manually; no consumer has to), and label overflow is defined: a label
  wider than its column crops at the column edge instead of rendering
  past the panel and off the window (measure with `text_width` to size
  deliberately). Widgets whose render legitimately leaves the rect —
  `dropdown`/`combobox` open lists, `menu`, `dialog`'s dim overlay,
  `grid`'s row-label gutter — opt out via their registry entry
  (`"clip": 0`). Proved twice: on recorded clip state in the stubbed
  suite and on real pixels in section [132], each with a planted fault.

### Changed

- **`when is x` counts assignments made inside `unobserved:` blocks
  (#908).** Two counters answered the same question — "how many times
  has `x` been assigned" — and disagreed. `when is x` read
  `env->assign_counts`, bumped only when `g_unobserved_depth == 0`;
  `when is x at L` and the occurrence ring read the history's own
  recorded-assignment counter, which has no such gate. They diverged by
  exactly the number of assignments made inside `unobserved:` blocks,
  and the unobserved assignment's *value* was recorded and readable the
  whole time — only the count omitted it.

  #868 made that divergence load-bearing: `<kw> is x when <n>` indexes
  the history's counter, because that is the only counter that can
  address a stored entry. So `when is x` — the natural way to discover
  how many assignments there are to ask about — reported a number that
  was short by one per unobserved assignment, and every ordinal computed
  from it was off. Matching the history downward would have been worse:
  the write happens and its value is retained, so dropping it from the
  ordinal space would leave an addressable-looking hole. The count came
  up to the history instead.

  `unobserved:` suppresses **observation** (entropy/dH), which is what it
  always documented; it never meant the assignment did not happen. The
  same principle that makes an observer predicate raise under one rather
  than answer from a dead trajectory applies here — a performance
  annotation must not change an answer. Nine gate sites in `vm.c`, four
  plus two first-binding sites in `eigenscript.c`, and the emitted
  sequence in the JIT's inline `SET_NAME` fast path (which re-read
  `EigsThread.unobserved_depth` through the `VM.owner` back-pointer) are
  all gone; the JIT bump is now unconditional behind its NULL check.
  Programs that both use `unobserved:` and ask `when is x` see a larger
  number.

- **`null.field` and `null["k"]` raise instead of yielding `null`
  (#872).** The contract makes dict-miss-returns-`null` a deliberate
  decision — a missing key is a lookup miss, not a logic error — but
  that rationale covers a *dict*, and `null` was the one non-dict type
  on which field access silently succeeded. So a typo'd config path
  propagated through arbitrary depth (`cfg.databse.host` → `null` →
  `null`) and surfaced somewhere unrelated, or nowhere. Walking through
  a miss now fails at the miss. A dict's own miss is unchanged and still
  `null`, on purpose. Fifteen access sites in `vm.c` carried the
  `!= VAL_NULL` exemption; all of them are gone, and the full suite
  passes unchanged — nothing depended on the absorption.

- **A discarded interrogative is a compile error (#869).** `what is 42`
  reads as an assignment, parses as a question about the literal `42`,
  and had **no effect at all**: the program ran to completion at rc=0
  with nothing on stderr. Only `--lint` caught it, and `what`, `when`
  and `where` are plausible variable names in exactly the domains this
  language targets. Every neighbouring mistake is loud — an unresolved
  name is fatal, `break` outside a loop is a compile error — so this was
  the odd one out.
  The check keys on the **discard**, not on the syntax, which is what
  makes it safe: the REPL and `eval` compile a unit whose last statement
  *is* the result, so `what is x` typed at the REPL still answers `=> 5`
  and interrogatives in expression position are untouched. Only a value
  nobody can read is refused. (A discarded interrogative as a unit's
  final statement is therefore still lint-only.) The interrogative word
  table is now shared between lint and the compiler rather than
  duplicated.

- **JSON is a lossless round-trip for every number (#875).** The
  contract promises `num of (str of x) == x`. That held for `str of` and
  for nothing else: `json_encode`, `json_build` and `json_path` each
  carried their own `%.15g` — one digit short of the 17 a double can
  need — so a value written as JSON and read back was a **different
  number**, silently, in the primary serialization format
  (`3.141592653589793` → `3.14159265358979`). Each also had its own
  integer fast path with its own bound (2^31, 1e9, 1e9), so every
  integer between it and 2^53 went through `%.15g` too: an ID of
  `1234567890123456` encoded as `1.23456789012346e+15` and decoded as
  `1234567890123460`. There were **four** hand-copies of the
  number→text rule (the fourth in the SIGUSR1 observer dump); there is
  now one, `eigs_num_text`, and `str of` calls it as well — so
  `json_encode of x == str of x` for every number and a fifth copy
  cannot appear with a fifth rule. One output change falls out of the
  unification: an exact integer below 2^53 renders bare rather than in
  exponent form, so `json_build of ["v", 1.23e15]` is now
  `{"v": 1230000000000000}` — 16 characters, matching `str of`, and
  still nothing like the 22-char fixed-point blob #725 removed.
  `tests/test_json_roundtrip.eigs` pins all three encoders against
  `str of` over the hard doubles and the exact-integer band, validated
  with a planted fault in each half (the precision escalation and the
  integer bound are independently load-bearing).
- **DB results carry their SQL type, and DB failures raise (#887,
  #888).** Two defects in one function, both silent. `db_query_json`
  emitted every column as a JSON string, so SQL `false` arrived as
  `"f"` — a non-empty string, therefore **truthy** — and
  `if row.is_admin:` passed for a non-admin; NULL and `''` were both
  `""` with no way to tell them apart; and `9 > 10` held because `'9' >
  '1'`. And every failure — syntax error, missing table, revoked
  permission, dead connection — returned `[]`, the same value a
  successful query over an empty table returns, so a reporting script
  kept printing "0 rows" forever after a schema change.
  Now: `PQgetisnull` → `null` (checked before the type), `boolean` →
  `true`/`false`, the exact-integer and float types → JSON numbers,
  everything else → strings, through **one classifier shared with
  `db_query_value`** so the two cannot drift. Failures raise a catchable
  `io` error carrying libpq's own first line; a genuinely empty result
  is still `[]`/`""` and only that. `db_connect` still reports by return
  value, so probing for a database needs no `try`.
  Two calls documented in `docs/BUILTINS.md`: **`numeric` stays a
  string** (arbitrary-precision decimal cannot round-trip through a
  binary double — silently rounding money is the defect class this
  fixes; `::float8` is the opt-in), and a **`bigint` past 2^53 raises**
  naming the column and the fix (`id::text`) rather than rounding a
  primary key. `bigint` is a number rather than a string because
  `count(*)` and `sum(integer)` return it — leaving it text would have
  left the bug unfixed for most real numeric queries. The mapping is a
  function of the column's SQL type alone, never of the row's value.
  `tests/test_db.eigs` gained the no-connection raise checks (they run
  wherever the extension is compiled in — previously the whole file was
  effectively inert without a server) plus DB18–DB26 against the live
  CI postgres service.
- **An observer predicate inside `unobserved:` raises instead of
  answering `false` forever (#871).** The block's depth is *dynamic* —
  it covers every function called from inside it — so a caller adding a
  performance annotation silently changed a callee's answer (a settle
  loop returned `-1` instead of `22`), and a bare
  `loop while not converged` inside one **never terminated**: the
  predicate could not become true, and the stall backstop that would
  have ended the loop is gated on the same depth, so both mechanisms
  that could have saved it failed for the same reason at the same
  moment. A predicate asked under an `unobserved:` block is being asked
  a question the runtime structurally cannot answer, and now says so —
  naming the predicate, the block, and the transitive scope. Everything
  that does not interrogate the observer is untouched, so the block
  remains the performance knob it is documented to be.
  Deliberately *not* fixed by ungating the stall backstop instead: that
  check reads a frozen trajectory as "quiet", so ungating it would exit
  every legitimate `unobserved:` loop after 100 iterations — including
  the accumulator loop README.md:189 measures at 2.7x. With the
  predicate raising, the hang is unreachable. And `unobserved:` was left
  dynamic rather than made lexical, because lexical scoping would
  exclude callees, which is most of what a hot region does.

### Fixed

- **EigenScript could not read a CRLF source file at all, and that is
  why the LSP was useless on Windows documents (#880).** The issue named
  the JSON-RPC unescaper, which was real: `src/eigenlsp.c` and
  `src/eigsdap.c` each hand-rolled the same five-escape subset, dropped
  `\r`, `\b`, `\f` and `\uXXXX`, and re-emitted the backslash — so a
  Windows client's text arrived with a literal backslash-r in it. But
  fixing that only got the CR as far as the lexer, which rejected it:
  `eigenscript win.eigs` died with `unexpected character` on **every
  line**. Not a tooling bug — the language, and a straight blocker on
  the Windows Tier-1 roadmap. The lexer now treats the CR of a CRLF pair
  as whitespace outside string literals (a CR *inside* a literal is data
  and is preserved; a lone CR is deliberately not a line break).
  Rather than write a sixth escape decoder, the runtime's own JSON
  string decoder — the one carrying #724's surrogate-pair handling — was
  extracted as `eigs_json_decode_string_body`, and all three callers now
  share it. Which made a third bug visible: **`json_decode` was missing
  `\b` and `\f` too.** Its default arm dropped the backslash, so
  `json_decode of "a\bc"` silently returned `abc` — the same subset gap,
  in the language's primary parser rather than in the tooling. A CRLF
  document now yields diagnostics byte-identical to the LF one.

- **The LSP advertises `positionEncoding: utf-8` (#881).** Positions are
  byte offsets, which is deliberate — `LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md` makes the
  byte model a language-level promise (`len of "café"` is 5) — so the
  server was internally consistent. The defect was not *saying* so: LSP
  3.17 reads a server that negotiates no `positionEncoding` as `utf-16`,
  so clients decoded byte offsets as UTF-16 code units and every range
  after a non-ASCII character landed in the wrong place, drifting
  further along the line with each one.
- **The gfx examples are actually run now — no build variant ever ran
  them (#886).** Section [97] skipped example programs by **content**
  (`grep -qE 'gfx_|net_listen'`), which is unconditional: `make gfx`
  builds the extension and [132] exercises the real SDL renderer, but
  the nine `gfx_` examples were skipped in every variant, so nothing
  covered them anywhere. The suite reported this honestly ("10 gfx
  skipped"); the gap was that nothing else covered them either.
  The skip is now gated on build capability (the same probe [132] uses),
  and under a gfx build each demo runs against the dummy video driver,
  memory-capped. A gfx demo ends in `ui.app_loop`, an interactive event
  loop that no quit event ever reaches headlessly — so *reaching* it
  (rc 124) is the pass signal: the program got through parse, module
  load, widget construction and layout without erroring, which is the
  failure class this catches. It deliberately does not verify loop
  behavior; [132] and the lib/ui sections own that. Validated with the
  issue's own bug planted back in (a call to the private `ui._layout`),
  which the section catches.
  Worth recording: that bug is **already gone** — `b49e85c`, an
  unrelated sandbox/zlib PR, deleted the offending line by accident
  after the issue was filed. Which is the issue's point exactly: with
  nothing running these, they break and get fixed invisibly. The example
  count under a gfx build goes 72 → 81.

- **`unobserved:` leaked its depth on every exit edge but one, silently
  killing the observer for the rest of the process (#871, found while
  fixing it).** `g_unobserved_depth` is a runtime counter that only
  `OP_UNOBSERVED_END` decrements, and the compiler emitted that opcode
  on the fallthrough edge only. A `return`, `break`, or `continue` out
  of the block — or **any error caught outside it** — left the depth
  elevated permanently: from then on the observer recorded nothing, and
  every `report` answered `equilibrium` about a value that was plainly
  moving. Four independent silent deaths of the runtime's central
  mechanism, none producing a diagnostic. Fixed the way #726 fixed the
  identical disease in `g_try_depth`: `break`/`continue`/`return` now
  emit the `OP_UNOBSERVED_END`s for every block they jump out of
  (per-loop baselines for the first two), and a `try` handler records
  the depth at registration and restores it when an error unwinds into
  the catch. `tests/test_unobserved.eigs` pins all four edges plus
  nesting, with a moving-value probe.

- **chart renders 1.5× faster at high point counts (#828).** The series
  hot loop called `_chart_map` — a fresh 2-element list — per plotted
  point per frame; at 4,000 points that allocation was ~37% of the frame
  (ceiling-probed), and under armed temporal history those lists are
  pinned (#827 amplifier, +3.9 MB/frame in the dynamics bifurcation
  consumer). The loop now inlines the mapping as scalar arithmetic with
  the view factors hoisted; every other `_chart_map` site (ticks,
  markers, hover) is cold and keeps the readable form. Measured n=5
  medians, 4,000-point points-style series under `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy`:
  62.7 → 42.6 ms/frame (~87% of the probed ceiling). A [63] check pins
  the inline mapping to `chart_to_pixel`'s exact floored pixels.
  Also added `chart_vline(x, label, color)` / `chart_hline(y, label,
  color)` — the same markers without the dead coordinate the generic
  `chart_marker` forces callers to invent.

- **import resolution is project-first, and a stdlib collision warns
  (#821).** `import name` now tries `name.eigs` (script-relative, plus
  the chain's other locations and the `eigs_modules` walk) **before**
  the stdlib's `lib/name.eigs` — previously stdlib-first, so a project
  file sharing a stdlib module's name was silently shadowed and every
  member access on the intended module read `null` (dynamics'
  `physics.eigs`, F-DYN-8; the stdlib namespace grows, so any consumer
  was one new stdlib module away from silent capture). A name matching
  both now prints a one-line stderr warning (once per name per process)
  naming the file used and the file shadowed. Sweep of the repo and all
  15 consumer repos found zero imports whose resolution flips.

- **`LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md`'s recommended midpoint index raised (#867).**
  The Indexing promise recommended `a[floor of (lo + hi) / 2]`, but `of`
  binds tighter than `/` — per the precedence table 25 lines above in
  the same file — so it parsed as `(floor of (lo + hi)) / 2` and raised
  `index must be an integer, got 1.5`. Now `a[floor of ((lo + hi) / 2)]`.

- **A corrupted `--bundle` executable refuses instead of silently
  starting the REPL at exit 0 (#882).** A bundle is the one artifact of
  this project designed to be copied and downloaded, so truncation is
  its normal failure mode — and a truncated bundle was
  *indistinguishable* from a plain interpreter: no magic at EOF, so
  startup fell through to ordinary CLI handling, found no script
  argument, opened the REPL, and exited 0. `./myapp && echo deployed`
  printed "deployed" for a corrupt binary. That contradicted the
  contract's "never report success on failure" while the tape layer next
  door already refused every damaged input with exit 3.
  Nothing at EOF can separate the two once the trailer is gone, so the
  archive gained a 24-byte **head magic** at its start (fmt 1 → 2),
  which survives truncation. Startup now refuses with exit 3 on: head
  present but trailer missing/unreadable, valid trailer whose named
  offset has no head, and — newly — a trailer naming a format this
  binary cannot read, which previously printed a message and then fell
  through to the REPL at exit 0 anyway.
  Two implementation notes, both load-bearing: the head magic is stored
  **XOR-obfuscated** in the runtime so its plaintext is not in the
  image's rodata — otherwise every plain `eigenscript` start would find
  the constant inside itself and refuse, bricking the interpreter — and
  the linear scan that finds a head without a trailer runs **only** when
  startup would otherwise open the REPL, so `eigenscript script.eigs`
  and every suite invocation pay nothing. The documented consequence is
  that a damaged bundle invoked *with* arguments still behaves as an
  interpreter; the shipped form (`./myapp`) is the case that matters.
  `tests/test_bundle.sh` covers all four states including the
  no-false-positive checks on the plain binary — plus a **fold guard**
  that greps the built interpreter for the plaintext magic, because the
  obfuscation is only as good as the compiler's willingness to leave it
  alone: gcc -O2 did not fold it, **clang did**, and CI's macOS job went
  red with every REPL check failing at exit 3. The key is `volatile`
  now, and a coincidental magic match is additionally rejected unless a
  well-formed entry header follows it.

- **vm_run_bytecode/sandbox_run: an assembled chunk's temporal opcodes
  now turn history recording on themselves (#831).** `g_trace_hist` was
  set only by the bytecode compiler's source scan, so a descriptor
  containing `prev`/`at` interrogate opcodes recorded nothing and its
  own temporal reads answered null — unless the HOST program's text
  happened to contain a temporal query, a relationship no bytecode
  producer (ouroboros codegen, iLambdaAi's vendored copy) can reason
  about. The descriptor assembler now replays the compiler's scan over
  the verified bytecode (`chunk_arm_temporal`, recursing into nested
  function chunks): per-name arming for `prev` (kind 6) and every
  `at`-qualified form, observer-state capture for where/why/how-at, and
  the wildcard on a `state_at` reference. Pay-for-what-you-use — a
  chunk with no temporal opcode arms nothing, so temporal-free
  producers keep recording off. Reproduced back to v0.34.0 (not a
  regression; split from #830, whose provenance rule fixed the
  filtering half). New suite `[70f]`.

- **ui: dispatch no longer swallows the rapid second click on widgets
  without a declared double-click meaning (#847).** The double-click
  branch consumed any second mousedown on the same id inside 400ms —
  even when the widget had no `on_dblclick` and wasn't an
  `editable_label` — so the click never reached the registry
  `on_mousedown` (piano double-tap retrigger, checkbox re-toggle, a
  second target under one dock id). The default is now inverted: only
  widgets that declared a double-click meaning consume the second
  click; everything else falls through. The `no_dblclick` registry
  opt-out (#848) remains as a type-level veto.

- **lint: the eigs.json allow-list parses fresh (#797).**
  `eigs_json_lint_allow_for` was the seventh lenient JSON parse root
  missed by #777's sweep: it never cleared `g_json_parse_err`, so a
  stale flag from an unrelated earlier parse in the same thread made
  the well-formed allow-list decode to an empty dict and warning
  suppression silently stopped applying. Unreachable from the CLI (one
  file, one process); bit embedders linting after a failed JSON parse.
  Now routed through `eigs_json_parse_root`; regression test in
  `embed_smoke` (the only consumer shape that can hit it).

- **json/store encode: magnitude checked before the double→int narrowing
  cast (#816).** `store_json_encode`, the builtin `json_encode`,
  `json_build`, and the json-path number formatter ran
  `(int)n` before the range guard — UB for any number beyond int's range
  (`store_put of [db, {"n": 1e300}]` reached it); correct output was a
  hardware accident (x86-64 `cvttsd2si`). Same class as #695. The guard
  now checks int's own range first, so the cast is always defined and
  the encoded bytes are unchanged. `make asan` now also compiles with
  `-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow` — GCC's `undefined` set does not
  include it, which is why the existing sanitizer gate was silent on
  this class.

## [0.38.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **`hex_view` — memory/byte-grid viewer (#850).** The rung-5 companion
  to the dock: a hex editor view (address gutter, 16 bytes per row,
  ASCII column) over a `reader(addr)` callback — a pure reader of any
  byte source (emulator bus, file buffer, store page) that never copies
  the memory and reads only visible bytes per frame (#828 awareness).
  Consumer-dict highlights under hex and ASCII, an accent cursor,
  gesture-only `on_select` (`hex_set_cursor` from code is silent), wheel
  scroll, `hex_view_metrics`/`hex_view_addr_at` as the geometry seams,
  `hex_*` theme keys in all three themes with fallbacks, whole-row
  software containment. Contract consumers in the suite: the DMG#53
  debugger memory panel and a record-inspector shape;
  `examples/ui_hex.eigs` is the runnable demo.

- **`dock` — multi-panel workspace layout (#848).** The fleet UI ladder's
  first "surface + tool panels" capability (every prior app is
  single-surface): a center widget surrounded by west/east panel stacks
  and a south panel row, with titled collapsible panels, drag-to-resize
  region edges (pointer-claiming, clamped to `min_size`/`min_center`),
  and `dock_view` exposing the full computed geometry as a consumer/test
  seam. Theme-keyed (`dock_*` keys in all three built-in themes, with
  fallbacks), children clipped via `gfx_clip`, `on_layout` fires only on
  user gestures (programmatic sizing/collapse is silent). Registry
  entries can now opt out of double-click detection (`no_dblclick`) — a
  widget whose one id hosts many click targets (the dock's handles and
  titles) must not have a rapid second click on a different target
  swallowed as a double-click. Contract consumers mapped in the suite:
  the DMG#53 emulator-debugger shape and a studio workspace shape;
  `examples/ui_dock.eigs` is the runnable demo.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **`timeline` — lane-based event timeline widget (#842).** The fleet UI
  ladder's shared widget: N labelled lanes over a time axis, items as
  plain dicts (markers `{t, lane, kind}`, spans `{t0, t1, lane, kind}`,
  extra fields pass through to `hover_item`), drag-to-pan +
  wheel-zoom-about-the-cursor in the body, drag-to-scrub in the ruler
  with an `on_scrub` callback and a settable/readable `cursor` — the
  seed-replay/anomaly scrubber seam. Theme-keyed by construction (new
  `tl_*` keys incl. the `tl_kinds` palette in all three built-in themes,
  with fallbacks; `timeline_style` keys item kinds to theme roles),
  clipped by construction (#823 discipline, proved on recorded
  primitives), and allocation-lean per frame (#828 awareness). The two
  contract consumers — liferaft's cluster visualizer (liferaft#18) and
  eddy's interleaving explorer (eddy#6) — each have a shape-mapping test
  in the suite; `examples/ui_timeline.eigs` is the runnable demo.

### Fixed

- **`make` keeps `eigsdap`/`eigenlsp` fresh across a VERSION bump (#825).**
  `make`/`make test` now version-check any aux binary present on disk and
  relink it on skew — so the release cut's VERSION commit can no longer
  leave a stale `eigsdap` whose tapes the #411 version gate then refuses
  (reported as 18 unexplained DAP behavioral failures on three consecutive
  cuts). The refresh triggers only on version skew, not source drift (no
  dev-loop tax); an explicit `make dap`/`make lsp` now tracks full
  source/header staleness via real file targets instead of always
  recompiling. `eigsdap --version` / `eigenlsp --version` print the linked
  runtime version, and `test_dap.sh` fails fast naming the actual cause
  ("stale binary; run `make dap`") on any remaining skew.

## [0.36.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **Wheel events carry the pointer as `ev.mx`/`ev.my` (#822).** A wheel
  event's `x`/`y` are the scroll deltas, so "where was the cursor when
  the user scrolled?" was unanswerable without shadowing every hover
  `mousemove` — a workaround that is wrong for the first wheel arriving
  before any motion (scroll-on-focus, precision-scroll devices).
  `gfx_poll` now attaches the pointer position at decode time via
  `SDL_GetMouseState` (version-independent; the wheel event's own
  `mouseX`/`mouseY` fields exist only from SDL 2.26 and would widen the
  hand-declared event struct — the #599 misalignment class). `dispatch`
  prefers the carried position for its wheel hit test and refreshes the
  tracked pointer from it; synthesized events without the fields keep
  the old path, so headless tests and older embedders are unaffected.
  First consumers: dynamics' cursor-anchored zoom (which ships the
  shadow workaround today), the EigenRegex live tester, DMG's debugger
  chrome, eigen-sheet's viewport.

- **`code_view` takes styled spans (#838).** `cv.spans` is a list of
  `{"start", "end", "bg", "fg"}` dicts — absolute half-open byte
  offsets into `cv.text`. `bg` paints a rect behind the range, `fg`
  recolors its glyphs over the base text (the font is monospace, so the
  overdraw is position-exact), a span crossing lines clips per line,
  and either color may be null. An empty list renders byte-identically
  to before, so the field is inert on consumers that never set it —
  which let the EigenRegex tester (match/group + Pike-VM pc
  highlighting) merge against the previous release with the field
  riding along dark. eigen-edit's syntax highlighting is the second
  consumer of the same seam.

### CI

- **The uniform `-Werror=switch` invariant is gated (#817, #836).**
  `tools/werror_switch_check.sh` dry-runs every compiling target and
  asserts every emitted compile line carries the flag, with a planted-
  fault self-test and a match-count floor so the gate cannot rot into a
  vacuous pass. (Contributed follow-up to #817's flag rollout.)

## [0.35.2] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **Temporal reads work again for producers that are not the bytecode
  compiler (#830).** #827 narrowed the assignment history to an armed-name
  set — and that set is populated only by `src/compiler.c`. The bytecode
  compiler is not the only producer of EigenScript programs: the AOT
  (sibling `ouroboros` repo) emits C and links the runtime without ever
  running the compiler, an embedder can drive the trace seam directly, and
  `vm_run_bytecode` / `sandbox_run` assemble a chunk from a descriptor. On
  all of those, nothing armed, `trace_assign` became a silent no-op, and
  every history-backed read — `prev of x`, `prev of x at L`, and the
  `at`-qualified `what/who/when/where/why/how` — returned `null` instead of
  the value. Three lines reproduce it (`x is 1` / `x is 5` /
  `print of (prev of x)`): v0.34.0 answered `1` on both the VM and the AOT,
  v0.35.1 answered `1` on the VM and `null` on the AOT. A **silent wrong
  answer**, shipped in a public release, that ouroboros's AOT differential
  caught (6 of 60 programs red) and this repo's own suite did not — because
  no test anywhere asked a temporal question through a non-compiler
  producer. Bare interrogatives read observer state, so they were
  unaffected, which is exactly why everything stayed green.

  The fix follows the chunk's provenance rather than a process-global mode.
  `trace_assign()` is the producer-facing entry point and now records
  unconditionally — a new producer is correct by calling it and nothing
  else. The narrowing moved to `trace_assign_filtered()`, used by the
  VM/JIT hooks only for a chunk carrying the new
  `EigsChunk.compiler_scanned` stamp, i.e. one the compiler produced and
  whose names it therefore armed. #827's dead-code optimization is kept in
  full on the compiled path (its `dead` case still sits at the
  no-temporal-query floor), and because retention is bounded by the
  suffix-minima pruning regardless of how many names are armed, arming was
  only ever a per-assign CPU filter — the memory gate
  (`tests/test_temporal_memory.sh`, suite `[70d]`) is unchanged at 2,944 kB
  flat, and its planted fault still takes it to 90,496 kB.

  The same defect reached hand-assembled bytecode: with recording on, a
  `vm_run_bytecode` descriptor asking `prev of` about its own name answered
  `1` at v0.34.0 and `null` at v0.35.1. That is fixed by the same rule.
  (A *separate*, pre-#827 gap remains: a descriptor containing temporal
  opcodes cannot turn recording on by itself, so it still answers `null`
  when the host program has no temporal query of its own — #831; it is not
  a v0.35.1 regression.)

  New coverage for the whole producer class, which is the half of this bug
  that let it ship: `tests/test_temporal_producers.eigs` (suite `[70e]`)
  drives `prev of` / `at` / `when at` through `vm_run_bytecode`, and
  `src/embed_smoke.c` (`make embed-smoke`, a CI gate) does it at the C
  level in the AOT's exact shape — `trace_assign` then `trace_query_prev`
  with no EigenScript source compiled anywhere in the process. Both fail
  against the pre-fix binary. Verified end to end against the real
  consumer: ouroboros's AOT differential harness goes 54/60 -> **60/60**.
  (ouroboros's own `EIGS_REF` bump also needs its `aot/build.sh` `CORE`
  list to pick up `src/builtins_host.c` — tracked in ouroboros#88, and it
  lands there with the bump, not here.)

  **The tape is untouched.** The provenance stamp gates only the in-memory
  history update (`prev_record_assign`); everything downstream of
  `trace_out_active()` — the `S`/`L`/`A` record writers — is unchanged, so
  `TRACE_FORMAT_VERSION` stays 2 and there is **no format-version bump
  (#411)**. Tapes recorded before and after are byte-identical and replay
  across the two binaries in either direction.

  **This narrows one claim in the v0.35.1 entry below.** That entry says
  the compiler "arms only those names, and assignments to any other name
  record nothing." As of this release that holds *only* for chunks the
  bytecode compiler produced (`EigsChunk.compiler_scanned`); on any other
  producer every assignment is recorded, because nothing scanned that
  chunk to arm it. The v0.35.1 text was accurate for the only producer it
  considered — that omission is the bug.

  **Who should take this release.** Anyone whose program reaches the
  runtime by a route other than `eigenscript prog.eigs`, together with
  `prev of` or an `at`-qualified interrogative
  (`what/who/when/where/why/how ... at L`) — concretely: the **AOT**
  (sibling `ouroboros` repo), the **embed API**
  (`docs/EMBEDDING.md`), and any **`vm_run_bytecode` / `sandbox_run`**
  producer driving a chunk it assembled itself. Those reads returned
  `null` instead of the recorded value: a **silent wrong answer**, with no
  error, no warning, and a plausible-looking result. Programs run through
  the normal CLI or `eval`/`load_file` were never affected, and bare
  (unqualified) interrogatives read observer state and were correct
  throughout. **Only v0.35.1 is affected** — the armed-name set arrived
  with #827, which first shipped in v0.35.1, so v0.35.0 and every earlier
  release answer correctly and this is not a reason to skip past them.
  A *separate* and older gap is still open: a `vm_run_bytecode` descriptor
  cannot turn recording **on** by itself, so it answers `null` when the
  host program contains no temporal query of its own. That is **#831**, it
  reproduces on v0.34.0, and it is **not fixed here**.

## [0.35.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **The temporal assignment history is bounded, and it no longer arms on
  dead code (#827).** The per-name history that backs `prev of x`,
  `<kw> is x at <line>` and `state_at` was append-only, uncapped, and held
  a *reference* to every value it recorded. Any long-running program that
  so much as mentioned `prev of` grew linearly until the machine died —
  `dynamics`' orbit lab retained 3.9 MB per rendered frame and hit 859 MB
  by frame 300; the minimal repro froze a 4 GB box for ~20 minutes with no
  OOM kill (power-cycle to recover). LeakSanitizer never saw a byte of it:
  every allocation was reachable from the history table and freed at exit,
  so this was unbounded *retention*, not a leak. Two independent defects,
  both fixed, with **no change to any temporal answer**:
  - **Unbounded retention.** The history is now pruned at append time,
    because a backward query makes most entries provably unreachable:
    entry `i` is dead exactly when some later entry `j` has
    `line[j] <= line[i]` (any `L` that admits `i` admits `j` too, and `j`
    wins for being later). What survives are the strict suffix minima of
    the line sequence, so the live entries are line-sorted and can never
    outnumber the distinct source lines that assign that name — bounded by
    program *text*, not by runtime. A loop reassigning one name a billion
    times now keeps one entry and pins one value. Two facts pruning would
    otherwise lose are carried explicitly so the answers are identical:
    each live entry stores its own execution-order predecessor (which is
    what `prev of x at L` returns, and it is usually a pruned entry), and
    a per-name `(line -> count)` histogram carries `when is x at L`, which
    counts pruned assignments. Backward queries became a binary search
    over the sorted live array, retiring the periodic line-floor segment
    index that existed only to make scanning an unbounded array
    survivable. Measured, 1.6M iterations: a live `prev of` went
    203,008 kB -> 2,944 kB, a live `at` query 53,248 kB -> 2,944 kB, both
    now flat in iteration count and equal to the no-temporal-query floor.
  - **Whole-program arming.** `g_trace_hist` was set by a source scan, so
    a `prev of v` inside a function nothing ever called switched on
    recording for every name in the program. Both history-reading forms
    compile to a NAMED opcode carrying a compile-time identifier, so the
    reachable name set is exactly known: the compiler now arms only those
    names, and assignments to any other name record nothing. `state_at`
    (it queries every name), an open tape, and turning recording on
    without naming a name (the REPL, `record_history of 1`) still arm the
    wildcard. The dead-code repro went 53,120 kB -> 2,944 kB. Under
    `spawn` the narrowing is deliberately given up: the armed-name set is
    a process-global array the compiler grows with `realloc`, and a worker
    calling `eval`/`load_file` compiles *concurrently* with other workers
    recording assignments, so the realloc could land under a reader
    walking the array. `spawn` therefore widens to the wildcard as its
    last single-threaded act, before the first `pthread_create` — the
    value is published to every worker by the same happens-before #297
    relies on, and the name array is never touched again. It widens
    *without* switching recording on, so a program with no temporal query
    does not start recording just because it made a thread (verified flat
    at the 2,944 kB floor from 200k to 1.6M iterations). Narrowing was
    only ever a per-assignment CPU filter; the history is bounded either
    way.

  **Semantics are unchanged and the tape is untouched.** The pruning drops
  only entries no query could reach, which is why
  `tests/test_temporal_pruning.eigs` — including the backward-line-jump
  counterexample that a line-keyed table gets wrong — passes on the
  pre-fix binary too, and why a 200-seed differential fuzz of every query
  form (`what`/`who`/`when`/`where`/`why`/`how`/`prev`, with and without
  `at`, plus `state_at`) against the pre-fix binary shows zero
  divergences on both execution tiers. `A` records are written
  independently of the history table, so tapes recorded before and after
  are byte-identical and a pre-fix tape replays byte-identically on the
  fixed binary — no format-version bump (#411). New gates: suite [70c]
  (semantics) and [70d] (`tests/test_temporal_memory.sh` — peak RSS
  ceiling *and* flatness across an 8x iteration range, which goes red on
  the pre-fix binary and on an answer-preserving-but-unbounded prune).
  [70d] probes for GNU `/usr/bin/time -f %M` *and* `/proc` and SKIPs
  where either is missing (BSD `time` has no `%M` and `ulimit -v` is a
  no-op there), because its thresholds are calibrated against Linux
  VmRSS accounting — so it is a Linux-only gate, verified to skip on a
  BSD-`time` stub and to still fail loudly on a genuinely missing binary.

  **Consumers should take this release.** This is a machine-freeze-class
  bug rather than a slow leak: on a 4 GB box the kernel thrashed instead
  of OOM-killing, so the machine had to be power-cycled. Every runtime
  through v0.35.0 is affected, and merely *mentioning* `prev of`, an
  `at`-qualified interrogative or `state_at` anywhere in a program —
  including in code that is never executed — was enough to trigger it.
  Workarounds pinned in place to dodge it (`dynamics` ships a
  `record_history of 0`) can be dropped once pinned at v0.35.1.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- **`lib/ui`'s `chart` is now an x-y plot (#819, closes #820).** Four
  consumers converged on the same missing capability — dynamics' phase
  portrait, eigen-sheet's recomputing 2D charts, EigenMiniSat's
  counters-over-time with restart markers, iLambdaAi's multi-run loss
  overlays — each of which was about to hand-roll it on a `canvas`.
  Rather than a second chart type, `chart` was generalized in place: a
  series carries its own optional `x` list (null keeps index-x, so a bare
  y-list plots exactly as before), the axes/ticks come from the data
  range with per-axis explicit overrides, `fixed_aspect` equalizes data
  units per pixel so a circle stays circular, `markers` overlay vlines /
  hlines / labelled points at data coordinates, and the view has a
  pan/zoom transform — drag to pan, wheel to zoom **about the cursor**.
  That last one is why the widget owns zoom: the pointer position lives
  in the toolkit's private `_ui` state, so a consumer doing this itself
  has to shadow every `mousemove` (#822); inside `lib/ui` it is just a
  read. New surface: `chart_series`, `chart_add_series`, `chart_marker`,
  `chart_add_marker`, `add_xy`, `chart_trim`, `chart_invalidate`,
  `chart_bounds`, `chart_view`, `chart_to_pixel`, `chart_from_pixel`,
  `chart_ticks`, `chart_pan_by`, `chart_zoom_at`, `chart_reset_view`.
  Two properties are structural rather than optional:
  - **Clipped.** These are live views of data that leaves the window, so
    every primitive is clipped to the widget: segments through a
    Liang–Barsky clip against the plot rect *before* they are drawn,
    marks as intersected rects, tick/legend/marker text truncated to
    measured width. `gfx_clip` is set for the real renderer too, but the
    containment is a property of the render code — which is what lets
    `tests/test_ui.eigs` prove it headlessly by recording every stubbed
    `gfx_*` call and checking its extent, at extreme pan and extreme
    zoom, with a planted unclipped primitive proving the probe is live.
    (Clamping the clipped endpoints after `floor` is load-bearing: an
    intersection parameter is a division, so an endpoint mathematically
    *on* the boundary came back as `ry - 1e-13` and floored one pixel
    outside — a series segment drawn one row above the plot area.)
  - **Incremental.** `add_point`/`add_xy` widen the cached data bounds in
    O(1) and the render-time scan visits only samples appended since the
    last frame, so a live plot at frame rate never re-walks its history.
    A series that is new, has shrunk, or no longer ends where the cache
    last saw it forces one full rescan; `chart_invalidate` covers the
    one case O(1) detection cannot see (a same-length in-place rewrite
    ending on the same sample).

  #820 lands with it: `chart`, `bar_chart` and `waveform_view` now read
  `plot_bg`/`plot_grid`/`plot_axis`/`plot_border`/`plot_series` and
  `wave_bg`/`wave_center`/`wave_border` off the theme instead of
  hardcoding them, with the current values as the defaults — so a themed
  app restyles the data surfaces, not just the chrome around them. A
  hand-built theme dict predating those keys falls back rather than
  failing. `add_point` moved from `lib/ui.eigs` to `lib/ui_w_viz.eigs`
  alongside the widget it belongs to.

- **`eigenscript --api [--json]`: the machine-readable surface index
  (#734).** One call answers "does X exist, and is it builtin,
  extension, or lib" instead of a text search across 729 lines of
  BUILTINS.md plus 1491 of STDLIB.md — the missing third leg beside
  `--lint --json` and `--test --json`. Builtins are enumerated from the
  live registry (never a hand list — the #459 lesson), extensions from
  `ext_names.h` by group (`gfx`/`http`/`http_request`/`db`/`model`/
  `net` — the LANGUAGE surface, independent of this binary's build
  flags), and every public `lib/*.eigs` define ships WITH its parameter
  list as written (defaults included; the no-paren form reports its
  implicit `n`), scraped from the same directories the import resolver
  searches. Text mode is greppable (`builtin sort_by`,
  `extension net net_dial`, `lib list.filter(items, fn)`); suite [131]
  pins the kinds, the params, JSON validity, and the
  sort_by-is-a-builtin / filter-is-lib split that misled agents.
  Discoverability fixes from the same issue: `CLAUDE.md` now routes
  `.eigs`-writing work to `docs/llms.txt` (the repo's best AI-facing
  reference was reachable only from README line 424), and BUILTINS.md's
  builtins-vs-library note now names `map`/`filter`/`reduce` explicitly
  — the exact greps that returned zero hits.

- **Lint `W022`: over-arity literal calls (#733).** With
  `define two(a, b)`, `two of [1, 2, 99]` binds `a=1, b=2` and silently
  DISCARDS `99` — rc=0, no diagnostic at any stage (under-arity at
  least null-fills and tends to fail later on a type error). W022 flags
  a bare literal argument list with more elements than the callee's
  parameters, conservatively: only when the callee name has exactly one
  `define` in the file and no other binding anywhere (assignment,
  param, loop/comprehension var, catch name, list-pattern name, import,
  or a match-pattern identifier all poison it). One-parameter callees
  never fire — a 2+-element bare list binds WHOLE to a single param by
  the #405 arity-1 carve-out (nothing is dropped; it's the variadic
  idiom), and `define f()`/`define f` both carry the implicit `n`, so
  every define has arity ≥ 1. Built on a new `LINT_FOR_EACH_CHILD`
  generic AST child iterator whose switch has no `default:` arm, so
  `-Werror=switch` forces new node kinds to update it.

- **`eigsdap`: a DAP server with first-class time travel (#539 v3,
  closing the #418 train).** `make dap` builds `src/eigsdap`, a Debug
  Adapter Protocol server over stdio that drives the SAME tape model as
  the CLI stepper — the model moved verbatim from `step.c` into
  `src/tape_read.c`, shared by both front-ends so they cannot drift.
  Because a tape is never executed, `stepBack`/`reverseContinue` are
  advertised capabilities and cost the same as forward: VS Code's
  reverse buttons work on every recorded run. Breakpoints verify
  against the tape's `L` records (a line the run never executed shows
  unverified); the call stack is the v2 scope chain; the variables pane
  shows each binding's folded value plus its #294 trajectory label and
  expands into its assign history as child nodes; `evaluate` resolves
  names innermost-first for hover/watch. The #411 version rule holds at
  `launch` — a tape from another version refuses loudly. The
  `editors/vscode` extension contributes the `eigenscript-tape`
  debugger type (adapter = `eigsdap` on PATH). Protocol coverage is
  pinned by `tests/test_dap.py` (suite [126], the DAP twin of
  `test_lsp.py`); CI compile-checks `make dap`. Docs:
  `docs/DEBUGGING.md`.

- **`ext_net`: raw TCP sockets as tape-recorded nondeterministic inputs
  (#414).** Seven builtins — `net_listen` / `net_port` / `net_accept` /
  `net_dial` / `net_recv` / `net_send` / `net_close`, with timeouts —
  behind `make net` (`EIGENSCRIPT_EXT_NET=1`, in no default build; also
  compiled into `make asan-http` so the sanitizer gate covers it). The
  differentiating contract: every nondeterministic outcome (accepted
  connections, received bytes, bytes-sent counts, dial results,
  kernel-assigned ephemeral ports) enters through the trace-tape seam,
  so a recorded session replays **byte-identically with no network
  present** — the replay run performs zero socket-family syscalls
  (strace-verified; suite section [125] pins the byte-diff and the
  tape's N-record count). Environment failures are recorded *values*
  (`null` / `-1` / empty buffer), never live-path-only raises, so a
  `catch` cannot desync replay; `net_send` is a suppressed recorded
  write (the `mkdir` rule, documented in docs/TRACE.md as the deliberate
  contrast to the #148 subprocess family). Sockets live in the process
  handle table (`HANDLE_NET`) and are closed by `handle_table_drain` at
  exit. `examples/net_echo.eigs` is a single-threaded both-ends echo
  session over the loopback backlog. TCP only for now — UDP stays open
  in #414.

### Changed

- **The per-request leak gate returns a dual-metric verdict (#770).** The
  gate measured only `VmRSS` over its 1000 + 3x2000-request window, and
  RSS is a proxy that goes blind whenever a leak is absorbed by resident
  free heap the process already owns: the literal #731 shape (a dropped
  `val_decref` in `builtin_shared_incr`, 72 heap B/req) passed at 0 kB
  while leaking unboundedly. Raising `MEASURE` to 20000 does catch it,
  but at 6-10x the wall clock (~30 s to ~4.5-6 min) and only moves the
  blind spot to a lower leak rate. The gate now samples **two** metrics
  at the same checkpoints and fails if either trips, because their blind
  spots are disjoint: a **heap leg** reading `mallinfo2().uordblks` (live
  arena bytes) out of the server itself through a new `heap_inuse` debug
  builtin on a `/heap_inuse` route — it sees the arena class from the
  first batch (~144-165 kB per 2000-req batch against a 64 kB threshold)
  and is immune both to free-heap slack and to the one-off per-thread
  arena mmap step that used to false-fail CI as an RSS step; and the
  **RSS leg** (threshold 4096 kB) which keeps exactly the class the heap
  leg cannot see — direct `mmap` at or above glibc's dynamic threshold,
  and thread stacks. Validated per #769 in both directions: the old gate
  passes the 72 B/req fault and the new one fails it via the heap leg
  (163/155/147 kB), reverted it passes (0-2 kB); a planted 512 kB/req
  direct-mmap leak fails via the RSS leg (~1,024,000 kB per batch) where
  a heap-only gate passed. The verdict self-test now covers 15 planted
  cases across both legs. The gate also proves it is talking to its own
  server: `ext_http` binds `SO_REUSEPORT`, so a stale server could share
  the port and silently split the gate's traffic while the batch counts
  still passed — which corrupted a real measurement of this gate — so
  both server scripts carry a `/gate_nonce` route probed 20x before
  measuring, and a mismatch is a loud INSTRUMENT failure. `heap_inuse` is
  glibc-only (null elsewhere, and the gate then skips, matching its
  existing platform skips) and is carved out under
  `EIGENSCRIPT_FREESTANDING` as well as `__GLIBC__`, since the
  freestanding profile compiles on a glibc host and the host's
  `mallinfo2` otherwise leaked into its import surface. Gate cost is
  unchanged (~30-50 s) and it stays Linux-only.
- **Host-only builtins moved to one whole-TU-gated file,
  `src/builtins_host.c` (#741).** `EIGENSCRIPT_FREESTANDING` was carved
  into `builtins.c` inline — 52 `#ifdef` blocks gating ~1,500 lines, with
  host-only builtins interleaved among portable ones, so the only feedback
  that a new builtin had leaked a host dependency was the freestanding
  symbol gate failing on a stray libc import. Everything needing a real OS
  underneath — filesystem (`read_text`/`write_bytes`/`ls`/… and the module
  resolver's host arm), subprocess (`exec_capture`, the `proc_*` family),
  terminal raw mode, POSIX regex (`match`/`match_all`/`regex_replace`),
  streams, `random_hex`, `build_corpus`, `read_file_util` — now lives in
  `builtins_host.c` behind a single `#if` (the `ext_store.c` pattern:
  under the profile the TU compiles to a no-op `register_host_builtins`
  plus the resolver stub). `builtins.c` keeps 5 conditional sites, all
  genuine dual-behavior carve-outs (glibc allocator introspection, the
  `getpid` seed term, `try_parse`'s stderr fd-plumbing), and its
  registration table calls the host registrar unconditionally inside the
  `[0, g_builtin_binding_count)` builtin band. Zero behavior change under
  the host profile; the freestanding surface is byte-identical (both
  `freestanding_check.sh` stages pass unchanged, allowlist untouched). A
  builtin that quietly grows a host dependency now fails the symbol gate
  by NAME (`builtin_foo` undefined in the profile) instead of by stray
  import, and the fix is structural — define it in the host TU. The
  matching extraction for `lint.c`'s 6 blocks (the E003 binding base,
  `--api`, `check_undefined_names`) is tracked separately.
- **The embedded-stack soak states what its 64 KiB budget is, and now
  tests the depth guard instead of assuming it (#758).** The gate's
  header called 64 KiB "the EigenOS boot-stack size"; per #758 EigenOS
  raised its boot stack as part of the #361 fix, so that reading was
  stale (EigenOS is a separate repo, so that is the issue's measurement,
  not one this repo's CI can check), and the budget was left tight on
  purpose — it is a per-AST-level regression tripwire, not a worst-case
  bound. Both the script header and
  docs/FREESTANDING.md now say so, and the doc records the policy the
  stale comment obscured: `PARSE_MAX_DEPTH` / `COMPILE_MAX_DEPTH` are
  fixed counts sized for a roomy boot stack, so on a constrained profile
  the binding constraint is the stack (caught by the guard page hosted,
  the canary bare-metal), not the depth count. Deriving the guards from
  the live stack was considered and rejected: it is a behavioural change
  to shipped guards on every profile, in exchange for a bound only as
  good as its per-level cost estimate, while the soak's value is exactly
  as a per-level regression detector. Because the guards are therefore
  *not* reachable under the soak's rlimit — measured, deeply nested
  source is SIGSEGV 20/20 at 64 KiB and needs ~144 KiB before the guard
  rejects it reliably — "the guard fires cleanly" had never been tested.
  The soak binary gains a `depth-guard` mode (source nested past
  `PARSE_MAX_DEPTH`, run at 256 KiB) and the gate now requires the
  guard's own diagnostic, a non-crashing exit, and a still-usable state
  afterwards.
- **Build variants now coexist: per-variant objdirs with dependency
  tracking (#740).** Every runtime variant (`build`/`full`/`http`/`zlib`/
  `net`/`gfx`/`asan`/`asan-http`/`tsan`/`valgrind`/`poison`) was a single
  whole-program `gcc` invocation writing `src/eigenscript`, so an ASan
  build destroyed the release binary, any edit cost a full 22-TU rebuild,
  and the project paid for the collision twice over — the test runner's
  binary-fingerprint guard (#681) and a standing CLAUDE.md prohibition.
  Each variant now compiles into its own `build/<variant>/` objdir with
  `-MMD`/`-MP` header-dependency tracking and links
  `build/<variant>/eigenscript`; `src/eigenscript` becomes a **hard
  link** the phony target re-points, so every existing consumer of that
  path works unchanged — hard rather than symbolic because the runtime
  resolves the stdlib relative to `/proc/self/exe`, which dereferences a
  symlink into `build/` and loses `lib/` (a symlink prototype failed 58
  suite checks exactly there; the hard link keeps the exec'd path in
  `src/`). Measured: switching `make asan` → `make` went from a ~90 s
  full rebuild to a 0.2 s relink; touching `vm.c` recompiles one TU;
  touching `vm.h` recompiles exactly its 12 includers. Target names,
  flags per variant, and output messages are unchanged. `pgo`/`coverage`
  (whole-program by nature) and `build.sh` now `rm -f` the alias first
  so they write a fresh regular file rather than truncating the shared
  inode under a variant. The fingerprint guard stays: re-pointing the
  alias or relinking the same variant mid-suite is still a mid-run swap,
  and the guard is what catches it (the guard's stat now uses `-L` so
  its metadata half describes the same file its cksum half reads) — what
  is retired is the cross-variant half of the prohibition, not the
  guard.

- **Entropy is now the current-state channel — recomputed at query time —
  and dH is the assignment-recorded trajectory (#711).** The stored slot
  entropy was a snapshot taken at the last assignment, so an in-place
  mutation (`dict_set`, `append`, an indexed scalar store) left it
  silently stale: two containers with identical contents reported
  different entropies decided purely by assignment history — measured
  fleet-wide at 1.42% of all folds (~127 stale observations per question
  asked). The split ends the class structurally for the channel people
  query: `where is x`, `report`, all six predicates, `observe`'s
  band/entropy elements, and `trajectory` snapshots now read the entropy
  of the value present at ask time (`observer_entropy_now`, O(own size)
  post-#685, slot read under the #607 lock, the value held across the
  walk). The fresh value is **never stored back** — a query cannot
  perturb the trajectory, so `why`/dH and its windows keep their
  assignment-sequence meaning (now documented as the deliberate
  contract, the narrow half of the issue's option 4 applied only where
  it is true by nature). No hooks were added to any mutation funnel —
  the hot paths are untouched; the recompute runs at the measured
  1-in-112,000 query rate (and per-iteration in observer-conditioned
  loops, same O as the assignment fold already paid there). Docs:
  SPEC.md (executable example), OBSERVER.md, PREDICATES.md. Suite [128]
  pins the issue's repro, indexed stores, observe/trajectory refresh,
  query purity, and the dH contract.

- **Function-valued bindings classify `opaque` instead of `equilibrium`
  (#708).** A function has no content the observer can sample — its
  entropy is a constant — so rebinding `f` from one function to a
  genuinely different one showed dH = 0 and `equilibrium` forever: a
  confident wrong answer on the surface whose claim is that it measures.
  Now every classification surface names the gap: `report`,
  `report_value`, and `observe`'s band answer `"opaque"`, and all six
  predicates are false, for a binding whose CURRENT value is a function
  or builtin (ask-time check — rebind to a number and its trajectory
  answers normally). The same visible-gap rule as `moving` (#735), and
  the same arm-by-arm review that fixed `VAL_JSON_RAW`'s flat 0.0. The
  entropy *constant* is deliberately unchanged: containers holding
  functions (dispatch tables everywhere downstream) measure
  byte-identically, tapes replay unchanged, and no numeric trajectory
  moves — only direct classification of a function binding changes, and
  its old answer was vacuous. Docs: SPEC.md (executable example),
  PREDICATES.md ("Opaque rule"), OBSERVER.md, COMPARISON.md. Suite
  [127] pins all surfaces plus the not-opaque half (numbers,
  containers, rebind-back).

- **`-Werror=switch` was paid for in `CFLAGS` and then opted out of at almost
  every `ASTType` switch, so adding a node type was a silent no-op (#738).**
  `Makefile:9` puts `-Werror=switch` in `CFLAGS`, but a `switch` carrying a
  `default:` arm is exhaustive by definition and `-Wswitch` has nothing to say
  about it. Measured at v0.34.0: of the **37** switches over `ASTType`, **36**
  ended in a `default:` and only `parser.c`'s `copy_ast` was exhaustive without
  one — so a 34th enumerator produced exactly **one** build error, while the
  compile dispatch, all 22 linter walkers and both LSP walkers skipped the new
  node without a word. Those `default:` arms are gone and the **617**
  enumerators they silently absorbed are written out, in enum-declaration order
  so they diff against the enum by eye, across `src/lint.c`, `src/compiler.c`,
  `src/parser.c` and `src/eigenlsp.c`. Adding an `ASTType` now fails the build
  at all **37** sites — 35 in the default `make` build plus the two `eigenlsp.c`
  walkers under `make lsp` — each naming the file and line that has not been
  taught about it. Strictly mechanical: every grouped arm does exactly what the
  `default:` it replaced did, so no emitted opcode, no lint W-code and no LSP
  answer moves and the suite output is byte-identical. One caveat worth knowing:
  `build.sh`, which CI's primary Linux and macOS legs use, had its own flag list
  and did **not** carry `-Werror=switch`, so the gate initially bit in the `make`
  legs (`full`/`http`/`zlib`/`gfx`/`lsp`) rather than everywhere — closed later
  in this same release, below.
- **Every compile line in the tree now carries `-Werror=switch` (#786, #817).**
  #779 made the flag a hard CI error on the `$(CFLAGS)` legs, but the legs
  contributors actually run locally use hand-written flag lists that omitted
  it, so a non-exhaustive `ASTType`/`ValType`/opcode switch only *warned*
  there. #786 armed `build.sh` (minimal, full, lsp compile lines) and `make
  asan`, `asan-http`, `tsan`, `valgrind`; #817 finished the job on the last six
  hand-written lists — `FLAGS_poison` (the one `VARIANTS` entry still missing
  it, so the uninit-read hunter was the single debug variant where a new case
  only warned), `jit-smoke`, `coverage`, `fuzz`, `fuzz-libfuzzer`, and
  `freestanding-libc-diff`. Every `$(CC)`/`clang` compile line in the Makefile
  now carries the flag; the only bare line left is `coverage`'s link step,
  which compiles nothing. No other warning flag changed and no general
  `-Werror` was added. All legs build clean with the flag armed under both gcc
  and clang, so no switch on any of those paths was non-exhaustive.
- **`eigenscript.c` no longer drags libpq's headers onto the core TU, and
  `vm.c`'s stale `extern` block is gone (#744, items 1-2).**
  `eigenscript.c` included `ext_db_internal.h` and `model_internal.h` and used
  nothing from either — the only core-to-ext include edge in the tree.
  Confirmed by set-difference before removing: of the 511 identifiers those two
  headers add to the TU's preprocessed token set, the 18 that also appear in
  `eigenscript.c` are all parameter/member names inside declarations, so zero
  declared entities were referenced. Concretely, before this change
  `eigenscript.c` in the `full` configuration without
  `-I/usr/include/postgresql` failed with `fatal error: libpq-fe.h: No such
  file or directory`; after, it compiles clean. Separately, `vm.c` carried 32
  `extern` re-declarations of symbols already declared in `eigenscript.h`, free
  to drift from it; 29 are removed. Three are kept with a comment saying why —
  `builtin_free_val`, `env_hash_find_dict` and `env_get_assign_count` have no
  declaration in any header and are called by `vm.c`. Behavior-neutral by
  construction *and* measured: `build/{release,full,http,gfx}/{eigenscript,vm}.o`
  are byte-for-byte identical to the same objects built from the parent commit,
  and the release suite log diffs to zero lines. Items 3-5 of #744 (the
  per-layer header split, the `eigenscript.h` umbrella, moving `read_file_util`
  out of the builtins leaf, and the `vm.c` / `builtins.c` splits) are
  explicitly still open.
- **`g_model` is documented as a reasoned process-wide opt-out, closing #739.**
  The #739 global-state sweep landed across #761 (trace teardown), #762
  (`g_exit_requested`) and #764 (task-suspend, `s_osr_threshold`,
  `g_sandbox_*`, `g_stream_file`, `g_db_conn`); the two deliberate remainders
  now resolve. `g_db_conn` was merged untested for lack of libpq, and the
  db-extension CI job (full variant, live postgres) has been green on every run
  since. `g_model` **stays process-wide by design**: per-state weights multiply
  a transformer's memory by the number of `EigsState`s and no consumer forces
  multi-state model isolation. The issue's own standard was the
  `g_vm_abort_flag` contrast — a reasoned, documented opt-out versus a silent
  one — so the reasoning now lives at the declaration. Comment-only diff;
  the binary is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **The global env is composed through one registration seam, and the
  LSP's builtin table is generated from it (#742).** gfx and store were
  registered by hand at each entry point — gfx only in `main.c`, so a
  `make gfx` build used through the embedding API had **no gfx builtins
  at all** (`gfx_open` raised `undefined variable`). `register_builtins`
  now composes store (always) and gfx (when built) itself, the five
  hand-call sites are gone, and `make embed-smoke-gfx` (new, in the
  extensions CI job) pins the embed+gfx leg that was broken. Store and
  gfx thereby move inside the `[0, g_builtin_binding_count)` builtin
  band, so `eigs_is_registered_builtin` now correctly claims them. On
  the tooling half: `eigenlsp`'s hand-written `builtin_docs` table — the
  repo's cleanest natural experiment in gating, at 68 of 235 builtins
  (29%) plus a phantom `exec` while the two *gated* registries sat at
  zero drift — is replaced by `src/lsp_builtin_index.h`, generated by
  `tools/gen_lsp_builtin_index.sh` from the registration seams +
  `ext_names.h` (names) and the signature comments above each C
  definition (hover detail): 336 names, set-identical to `--api`'s
  registry, 202 with signature detail, the rest falling back to a
  BUILTINS.md pointer rather than papering over the missing comments. A
  build artifact like `lsp_stdlib_index.h`, never committed. Completing
  the table surfaced the builtin/stdlib name collision the old table
  hid by omission (`mean` is both a tensor builtin and `stats.mean`):
  hover now treats a dotted token as a member access — only the
  module-qualified stdlib branch may claim it, so `stats.mean` hovers as
  the stats function and bare `mean` as the builtin.

- **The GC's two lockstep dispatches are generated from one table, and
  `CallFrame` init/release have one definition each (#743).** The
  lockstep between `GC_FOR_EACH_CHILD` and `gc_clear_node` was enforced
  only by prose, and had already drifted: the walker reported a
  `VAL_FN`'s compiled-chunk edge (`body_count == -1`, the ref taken in
  `OP_CLOSURE`) that `gc_clear_node` never cleared, so that ref was
  recovered only later by the value destructor in the unpin pass — a
  third mirror the comment never named. Both dispatches now expand one
  `GC_EDGE_TABLE` X-macro (one row per owned edge, walk predicate and
  clear action side by side), so a new owning edge out of
  Value/Env/Chunk is written once and the two cannot drift; the
  destructor is documented as the non-cycle mirror, and the two safety
  invariants of the chunk row's clear are spelled out at the table
  (`make_fn` leaves `body = NULL`, which is what makes the
  unconditional `chunk_decref` type-safe; the `body = NULL` in the
  clear is load-bearing against a later double-decref). Since rows are
  selected by `_v->type == VAL_x` guards, which `-Werror=switch` cannot
  see, `gc_value_is_node` carries #738's build-error property for the
  table: its switch is exhaustive and a value type is a node exactly
  when it has rows (verified by planting an 11th enumerator).
  Alongside it, `CallFrame` had five hand-written init/teardown sites:
  all four push sites (`jit_helper_call`, `vm_run_ex` entry, `OP_CALL`,
  `OP_DISPATCH`) now use `callframe_init`, and all three saved-frame
  teardown loops (`task_sched_thread_free` and `task_do_kill` in vm.c,
  `task_free` in builtins.c) share `callframe_release` — declared in
  vm.h, the one definition of the owned-field set {env iff `owns_env`,
  chunk}. The live-frame POP paths keep their inline drops on purpose
  (they also drain the operand-stack window, restore the per-frame
  stall globals, and park reusable envs — a plain release would be a
  subset), and vm.h now flags them for audit. The refactor fixes the
  bug it was designed to catch: the `OP_DISPATCH` push never stamped
  `saved_stall_count`/`saved_loop_iter`, so interpreted dispatch
  restored unstamped counters on RETURN — a dispatch-per-iteration
  loop's `__loop_iterations__` froze at 1 after the first dispatch
  return, and now tracks the loop. Contributed by @Nitjsefnie (#810);
  section [87]'s strict closure-cycle leak gate covers the collector
  half.

- **EigenStore round-trips buffers instead of dropping them (#805).**
  `store_json_encode` wrote a `VAL_BUFFER` as JSON `null`, so
  `store_put of [db, "c", {"b": buf}]` followed by `store_get` handed
  back a null and the bytes were gone — the data-loss gap the #738
  exhaustiveness sweep made visible. A buffer now encodes as a tagged
  object, `{"_eigs_buffer":[…],"_eigs_shape":[rows,cols]}`, that the
  store's decoder rebuilds as a `VAL_BUFFER` at any nesting depth. The
  alternative — a bare numeric array — round-trips as a **list**, and a
  store that silently changes a value's type is the same class of bug.
  Shape travels with it (`shape of` reads rows/cols back, so dropping
  them is data loss too), elements use `%.17g` so a non-integral buffer
  comes back bit-exact (as trace.c's tape encoding already did), and a
  non-finite element — reachable, the flat-buffer matmul kernel
  accumulates unguarded — rides as `"inf"`/`"-inf"`/`"nan"` rather than
  as a bare `inf` that would make the whole *record* unparseable.
  **The tag's cost, stated plainly:** a user dict with exactly the two
  tag keys, a body list of numbers (or those sentinels), and a shape
  list of two integers satisfying `rows*cols == count` (or `[0,0]`) now
  decodes as a buffer. Nothing else does — a third key, a missing key, a
  non-list body, a foreign string element, or an inconsistent shape all
  stay a dict, and a top-level record is never at risk because
  `store_put` stamps `_id` onto it. `STORE_VERSION` is deliberately not
  bumped (`store_read_header` rejects any other version, so a bump would
  make every existing database unopenable); old files decode exactly as
  before, and an older binary reading a new file sees a plain dict
  rather than failing. One consequence: a buffer costs real bytes where
  `null` cost four, so a large one can push a record past
  `STORE_MAX_RECORD_SIZE` and raise "record exceeds page size" — the
  limit a long list already hits, and a loud refusal beats a silent null.

- **The `ValType` switches are now exhaustive too, closing out the #738
  sweep — and the first build immediately caught real drift (#738).**
  The ASTType half of #738 landed earlier (see below); this finishes the
  issue: the remaining `default:` arms over closed enums are gone from
  `val_type_name`, the Value destructor, `values_equal`,
  `chan_clone_rec`, `GC_FOR_EACH_CHILD`, `gc_clear_node`,
  `eigs_value_type` (embed API), `store_json_encode`, both trace-tape
  value formatters, the observer dump, and `OP_SLICE`'s type check — a
  new `ValType` is now a build error at 16 sites (verified by planting
  an 11th enumerator), instead of a silent leak in the destructor plus a
  wrong answer everywhere else. One `ASTType` straggler is also cleared:
  W022's binding collector, added *after* the sweep, had reintroduced a
  `default:` arm — the exact drift mode the issue predicted. The
  enforcement's first compile found real drift: `store_json_encode` did
  not handle `VAL_BUFFER`, so a buffer stored through ext_store silently
  encodes as `null` (data loss — kept behavior-preserving here, tracked
  as #805), and the trace tape's full nondet formatter renders
  `VAL_JSON_RAW`/`VAL_TEXT_BUILDER` as opaque `<heap>` where the short
  form has `<json>`/`<text>` (latent; noted in #805). All grouped arms
  are otherwise strictly mechanical — suite output is byte-identical.
  Legitimately open switches keep their `default:`: untrusted bytecode
  bytes (the leaf-accessor scan, the non-GNU dispatch arm), guarded
  subsets (JIT binop/cmparm emitters, compound-assign tokens), and
  `TokType` (out of #738's scope).

- **The opcode operand-layout tables are now exhaustive switches on
  `OpCode`, closing a verifier drift (#737).** `op_name`,
  `op_verify_operands`, and `op_stack_effect` each switched on `uint8_t`
  with a `default:` arm, so `-Werror=switch` (already in CFLAGS) could
  not see a missing opcode — and three had already drifted:
  `op_verify_operands` was missing `OP_TRAJECTORY_SLOT` (its NAME
  sibling was present), so the untrusted-chunk verifier walked that
  3-byte instruction as 1 byte and marked its two operand bytes as valid
  instruction boundaries — a crafted jump could land mid-instruction and
  still pass verification (the #721 surface, reopened); `op_name` printed
  four opcodes as `"???"`; and the disassembler's separate `op_has_u16`
  boolean had drifted on 8 opcodes and structurally could not express the
  multi-operand superinstructions, desyncing on 15. All three now switch
  on `OpCode` with no `default:` arm (a new opcode is a build error, not
  a silent gap), `op_name`'s strings are derived from the enum spellings
  so they can't drift from their opcodes, `OP_TRAJECTORY_SLOT` is
  verified, and the disassembler is driven off the verifier's operand
  table (one layout source, not two). The verifier hole is
  planted-fault-gated by `test_vm_run_bytecode.eigs` (a jump into
  `OP_TRAJECTORY_SLOT`'s operand: refused now, ran to `7` on the drifted
  table).

- **The AI-facing spread-rule docs now state the arity-sensitive rule
  the runtime actually has (#733).** `docs/llms.txt`'s "#1 TRAP"
  paragraph still described the PRE-#405 semantics (claimed
  `f of [x]` binds the whole list — the opposite of today's runtime),
  and its "which spreads" framing predicted the wrong binding for every
  2+-element call to a 1-parameter function (`one of [5, 6]` binds
  `a = [5, 6]`, not `a = 5`). The call section now states both halves —
  bare-list-is-an-arg-list at the call site, arity-1 re-collection at
  the binding — plus the silent over-arity behavior and W022.
  `CLAUDE.md`'s always-on rule gains the same carve-out sentence
  (docs/SPEC.md already had it). llms.txt also gains the four gaps the
  #733 experiment hit: `lib/` is NOT ambient (`import list` namespaced
  vs `load_file of "lib/list.eigs"` bare), lambda syntax, `sort_by`
  (a builtin, no import), and the comprehension `if` clause.

- **The leftover-token parse error diagnoses the actual mistake instead
  of always saying "one statement per line" (#732).** The four most
  likely model/newcomer mistakes — `print("hello")`, `def f(a):`,
  `f is x => x + 1`, `say x` — all landed in `p_end_statement`, whose
  blanket hint named a rule none of them broke (and `docs/llms.txt`
  taught the same misdiagnosis, so the reference and the diagnostic
  wrongly confirmed each other). The hint is now specialized on the
  leftover/predecessor tokens: paren-style calls get "calls use 'of':
  write f of x", a bare `=>` gets the parenthesized-lambda form, a
  lone-identifier statement gets a name-check hint (with `def`
  specifically pointed at `define … as:`), and everything else keeps the
  original text — `x is 2 x is 3` still says "one statement per line".
  Also from the same pass: a statement that already reported a parse
  error no longer stacks a spurious "unexpected X after statement" on
  its debris (`add2 of (1, 2)` now gets exactly one error, the real
  one), and the llms.txt validation-ladder entries for this signature
  now describe the specialized hints (including that the caret sits one
  token AFTER the mistake). The recorded `--lint --json`/LSP message is
  unchanged (`unexpected X after statement`) — the hint is
  display-layer. Five new `examples/errors/` demos pin the hints, plus
  an `# expect-error-count:` harness extension pinning the
  single-error cascade behavior (suite [90], now 19 checks).
- **`json_decode` no longer reads past the allocation on a string ending
  in an escape backslash (#776).** The escape branch stepped onto the
  terminating NUL, appended it, and the loop guard then read one byte
  past the input (ASan heap-buffer-overflow). A trailing escape is
  truncation: it now raises the same structural `invalid JSON` error as
  any other unterminated string, from every nesting level. First
  external contribution — reported with an ASan repro and fixed by
  @Nitjsefnie (#799), tests JH98–JH106.
- **One malformed lenient parse no longer poisons the next JSON parse on
  the same thread (#777).** The parser checks `g_json_parse_err`
  mid-parse, but only `json_decode` ever cleared it — a stale flag from
  a failed `json_path`/`ext_http` parse truncated the next parse's
  arrays after one element and emptied its objects at the first key. A
  new single owner, `eigs_json_parse_root`, clears both parse flags at
  every top-level entry (`json_decode`, `json_path`, and the four
  ext_http sites); callers no longer touch the flags. Also by
  @Nitjsefnie (#798), tests JH118–JH127; the seventh root it uncovered
  in `lint.c` is tracked as #797.
- **JIT thunk invocation is gated on `g_vm_multithreaded`, matching the
  OSR site (#728).** #296 gated JIT *compilation* off under MT, but a
  chunk compiled on main before the first `spawn` was still runnable
  from workers — and every thunk epilogue writes the shared
  `chunk->jit_advance`, while in-thunk helpers
  (`jit_helper_get_name`/`set_name*`) fill the shared
  `env_ic`/`const_hashes` caches that the interpreter only touches under
  `!g_vm_multithreaded` (#297). Two workers running one warm thunk raced
  write/write on both (TSan-visible in the IC fill; the epilogue store is
  uninstrumented emitted code, which is why no repro existed before).
  The OP_CALL and OP_DISPATCH invocation sites now carry the same
  `!g_vm_multithreaded` gate as OSR, `jit_helper_call` refuses nested
  thunk entry after a mid-thunk `spawn` flips the flag, and OP_DISPATCH's
  `exec_count++` picked up the #297 gate its OP_CALL twin already had.
  Workers interpret shared chunks — the same ruling as OSR/compilation.
  New warm-then-spawn-parallel shape pinned by suite [129]
  (`test_spawn_jit_warm.eigs`) and the `test_tsan.sh` race-free slice.
- **The JIT's inline decref runs the #307 possible-cycle-root hook
  (#728).** The emitted decref decremented and freed at zero but never
  called `gc_note_possible_root` on a surviving LIST/DICT — the hook
  `slot_decref`/`val_decref` always run. Ordinarily masked because every
  cycle is registered at creation by C-path decrefs, but
  `gc_collect_cycles` *unbuffers* live candidates, so a cycle that
  survived a collection and then lost its last external ref in emitted
  code (an OSR-compiled loop rebinding the variable) was invisible to
  the exit collector: 136 bytes leaked per orphan, reproduced and
  planted-fault-verified. The decref tail now emits the hook arm at the
  sites that drop arbitrary values (OP_POP, SET_LOCAL swap, inline
  SET_NAME old-binding); the binop commit decrefs and INDEX_SET stay
  hookless — their type guards bail non-num/non-buffer operands to the
  interpreter before any commit decref, and the arm would be pure
  I-cache bloat there (measured ~12% on `bench_dmg_shape` when emitted
  unconditionally, flat with the split). Strict-leak-gated by suite
  [130] (`test_jit_cycle_root.eigs`), the JIT analogue of [106].

- **The JSON model loader validates before committing (#727).** The
  `.eigen` binary loader always parsed into a temporary, checked every
  section present, and committed only on success; the JSON path parsed
  straight into the live model and set `loaded = 1` with `format_version`
  as its only gate. Three concrete failures, all now rejected loudly
  (and all reproduced by the planted-fault run of the new tests against
  the old code): a `layers` array shorter than `config.n_layers` left
  weight pointers NULL — a **segfault** in `requantize_all_layers` at
  load time (`json_parse_layer`'s return was discarded); a weight array
  placed before `config` was allocated from a zeroed config, then
  indexed by the real `vocab_size` at inference — heap-OOB read; and a
  checkpoint missing whole sections still marked itself loaded. The JSON
  path now mirrors the `.eigen` discipline: stack temporary,
  config-must-precede-arrays ordering, per-layer parse-return checks,
  config range validation (`n_layers ≤ MAX_LAYERS`, positive dims),
  completeness check, commit-on-success only — a failed load leaves the
  live model untouched (pinned by test MI5). Loading untrusted weight
  files is in scope per SECURITY.md. Suite [47d]
  (`test_model_incomplete.sh`, 5 checks).

- **`json_decode` mangled escaped astral characters and silently truncated at
  an escaped NUL (#724).** Every `\uXXXX` escape was UTF-8-encoded on its own,
  so a surrogate pair came out as 6-byte CESU-8 (invalid UTF-8) instead of one
  4-byte scalar — and `\u0000` appended a 0x00 byte into a C-terminated
  string, dropping the rest of it with no error. Surrogate pairs are now
  combined per RFC 8259; an unpaired surrogate, an escaped NUL (strings cannot
  carry 0x00 — see EMBEDDING.md), and a malformed `\u` escape (non-hex digit
  or fewer than four digits, previously accepted as garbage) now raise under
  strict decode, while lenient callers (`json_path`, the HTTP extension)
  receive the complete document with U+FFFD in place of the one bad scalar —
  the substitution rides a separate recoverable-error flag, so it never trips
  the #495 propagation checks that abort a container parse. Previously
  accepted garbage escapes raising is an intentional strictness change, not a
  regression.

- **`random_int` returned a wrapped garbage value for bounds it could not
  serve, and `json_build`/`json_path` printed floats with `%.6f` (#725).**
  The bounds went straight through an `int` cast, so a non-finite or
  out-of-int64 bound was undefined behaviour at the cast itself, and any span
  wider than the 31 bits `lrand48` supplies was silently wrapped by the
  modulo. `random_int` now range-checks the bounds as doubles before any
  integer cast and raises a catchable `EK_VALUE` error on a non-finite or
  out-of-int64 bound and on a span over 2^31 — a span of exactly 2^31 stays
  legal, since `lrand48` yields exactly 31 bits — and the span is computed in
  `uint64_t` so a wide-but-legal int64 range (e.g. `INT64_MIN..0`) cannot
  overflow the check itself. In the same PR, `json_build` and `json_path`
  now print non-integral floats with `%.15g`, unifying them with
  `json_encode`: `%.6f` flattened tiny magnitudes to `0.000000` and rendered
  huge ones as 22-character fixed-point blobs. The raise is an intentional
  strictness change, not a regression — a caller that depended on the
  wrapped value was already wrong.
- **Six lint walkers went blind inside `unobserved:` blocks and `match`
  arms (#781, #782, #783, #784, #785).** `src/lint.c`'s walkers recursed
  through `IF`/`LOOP`/`FOR`/`FUNC`/`TRY`/`PROGRAM` but broke on
  `AST_UNOBSERVED` and `AST_MATCH`, so an entire subtree of a program was
  never reached and the affected rules simply never fired there — while the
  *same* code at top level warned. Fixed across the family, each matching the
  recursion shape `collect_refs`/`collect_loop_assign_names` already used:
  `check_builtin_shadow` (W012 assignment-shadows-builtin, W013
  define-shadows-builtin — #784, #785), `collect_assigns` (W001 unused
  variable, which broke on `AST_MATCH`), `check_func_unreachable` (W003 dead
  code after a return — #782), `check_unused_params` (W002 — #781), and
  `check_dup_keys` (W010 duplicate dict key — #783). The diagnostics
  themselves are unchanged; what changed is where they are looked for.
  Consumers linting code that uses `match` or `unobserved:` will see warnings
  that were previously silent.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-07-31

### Security

- **`json_encode` had no depth bound, so a cyclic value segfaulted the process
  (#730).** The decoder has been bounded at `JSON_MAX_DEPTH` since #495; the
  encoder walked the Value graph with no counter and no cycle check. A Value
  graph *can* contain cycles — the cycle collector exists because it can — and
  building one takes two lines (`dict_set of [d, "self", d]`, or
  `append of [a, a]` by accident). The walk then recursed until the C stack was
  gone. The crash was **uncatchable**: `try`/`catch` does nothing against a
  SIGSEGV. `print` already handled cycles, which made `json_encode` the
  surprise. Reachable from `json_path` and, more seriously, from
  `shared_set` — an HTTP handler storing a self-referential value took the
  whole server down. Both directions now share one limit, so a document that
  decodes always re-encodes; exceeding it raises a catchable `EK_VALUE` error
  rather than emitting truncated JSON, which would have been the
  silent-wrong-answer class this audit was closing. Depth rides the C stack as
  a parameter rather than a thread-local counter, so it cannot leak across a
  bail-out. `eigs_json_encode` now returns NULL on refusal and its two
  `ext_http.c` callers check it instead of `strlen`-ing the result.

- **Content-Length was matched by substring, so a header value could frame the
  body (#715).** The read loop located the header with a single
  `strcasestr(reqbuf, "Content-Length:")` over the whole header block, so the
  first hit anywhere won — inside another header's *value*
  (`X-Note: Content-Length: 0`), as a suffix of another header's *name*
  (`X-Content-Length: 0`), or in the request target
  (`POST /x?q=Content-Length:0`). The server framed the body at the decoy's
  length, left the read loop early, and dispatched the `code` route with an
  empty body; it also let a client hide an oversized real length behind a small
  fake one and dodge the `> max_body` 400. The header block is now walked line
  by line, matching only at a line start with the colon required immediately
  after the name, and two `Content-Length` headers that disagree are rejected
  with 400 instead of the first silently winning. Reachable only when the body
  arrives in a *separate* write from the headers — sent as one packet the body
  is already buffered when the loop breaks, which is why the pre-fix build
  passes a single-write version of the same test (HS29–HS31).

- **`http_post` did not strip CR/LF from outbound header names or values
  (#716).** Both halves reached curl's `-H` verbatim, so a `\r\n` in either
  injected additional headers into the outbound request — the class the
  runtime already recognised one screen away in `http_cors`. Script-controlled,
  so not a vulnerability on its own under the SECURITY.md threat model, but a
  `code` route that forwards a client-supplied header value into an
  `http_post` makes it one. Both now run through a shared `http_strip_crlf`,
  which `http_cors` was rewritten onto so there is one implementation (HS32).
  SECURITY.md now also states outright that the *destination* of an outbound
  request is out of scope — there is no loopback/link-local blocklist, and the
  guarded transport (`--proto`/`--proto-redir` pinned to `http,https`) was
  inviting the assumption that the destination was guarded too.

- **`chunk_verify` let an untrusted chunk run off the end of its code
  (#721).** The verifier checked opcodes, operand bounds and jump targets but
  never that execution *terminates* — "the caller supplies a chunk ending in
  `OP_RETURN`" was documented as a caller obligation, which is precisely the
  trust `sandbox_run` exists to remove. A chunk with no terminator ran into the
  zeroed slack of the code buffer, where byte `0` decodes as `OP_CONST[0]` and
  the VM pushed `constants[0]` with no NULL check: `vm_run_bytecode of ([1, [1],
  []])` was a one-line segfault. Verification now requires the last instruction
  to be a return or an unconditional jump. Two more holes on the same surface,
  both reachable only from a hand-built descriptor, closed with it: `OP_ITER_NEXT`
  read its index slot as a number with no type check and bounds-checked only the
  *upper* end, so a negative index read below the list and `val_incref`'d an
  arbitrary pointer; and a descriptor's constant pool was loaded through the
  *deduplicating* add, so a repeated number or string collapsed two entries into
  one, shifted every later index down, and the code then loaded the wrong
  constant with no error anywhere (descriptor pools are now positional, and a
  hole in one is rejected rather than renumbered).

- **`--lint` on a machine-sized file overflowed the stack (#723).** The
  top-level function-name collector wrote into a fixed 512-entry stack array,
  but `program.count` has been unbounded since #327 removed the fixed statement
  caps — so the write was bounded only by the input. 600 top-level `define`s
  is a confirmed stack-buffer-overflow under ASan, and it is reachable twice
  over: `eigenscript --lint`, and the LSP's `lint_collect`, which means opening
  a generated file in an editor corrupted the language server's stack. 512 is
  an ordinary size for generated EigenScript. The collector now sizes to the
  statement count. Same file, same rule: `check_unused_params` declared an
  ~85 KiB `LintContext` *by value* inside a function that recurses into nested
  `AST_FUNC`s — the PR #361 class, reintroduced in the lint pass — now
  heap-allocated. (Not currently crashable: the parser's depth limit caps the
  recursion below what an 8 MiB stack needs. The 64 KiB EigenOS boot stack has
  far less headroom, which is how #361 surfaced.)

- **HTTP slow-loris: one source could deny all service (#718).** The HTTP
  extension is thread-per-connection with a hard ceiling of 256 workers and,
  until now, only a single *global* connection counter. Pointing a real client
  at a live `eigen-site` host (the audit-vs-attack pass) showed the cap is the
  weapon, not the shield: **256 partial-header connections from one address —
  6.4 KB sent, then silence — take every worker slot and every legitimate client
  gets `503`**, and a byte-per-second trickle holds a slot for the full 30s
  deadline (measured 31.5s). Path traversal, malformed framing, and memory-
  safety all held (RSS flat, no crash); availability did not. Three bounds now
  close it, all env-tunable:
  - **per-source-IP connection cap** (`EIGS_HTTP_MAX_CONN_PER_IP`, default 48) —
    one address may not hold all 256 slots; excess gets `503`. Set to `0` behind
    a reverse proxy (where every connection carries the proxy's address).
  - **header-phase deadline** (`EIGS_HTTP_HEADER_TIMEOUT`, default 10s) —
    separate from and shorter than the 30s total-request deadline, because a
    slow *header* phase is a slow-loris, not a slow upload.
  - **minimum header data-rate** (`EIGS_HTTP_HEADER_MIN_RATE`, default
    256 B/s, Apache `mod_reqtimeout`'s MinRate) — a trickle that clears neither
    the deadline nor the rate floor is dropped (`408`) in ~a read cycle instead
    of holding a worker for 30s. A real client sends its header block in one
    packet and never reaches either bound.

  These raise the bar for a single-source attack sharply but do **not** make a
  thread-per-connection server slow-loris-proof against a *distributed* attack —
  the structural fix is an event-driven connection layer or a reverse proxy in
  front. `eigen-site`'s README now recommends the proxy posture for any
  internet-facing deployment.

- **`sandbox_run` did not contain (#713).** The sandbox is the runtime's only
  advertised containment boundary — it filters *names* in the environment, and
  three things reach past a name filter. All three were confirmed by working
  repro, not inferred.

  **Write-through.** The sandbox env was a child of the host global env, and
  `is` is an *outward* assignment (`OP_SET_NAME`): `env_set` walks the parent
  chain and writes to the first env already holding the name. Allowlisted names
  were deliberately unshadowed, so they resolved straight through — a sandboxed
  `sum is 42` rebound the *host's* `sum`. Planting a closure that way was
  worse: replacing `secure_equals` with `fn(a, b): return 1` made the host's
  token comparison answer 1, and the plant ran in host context the next time
  the host called that builtin, with the loop cap and allocation budget already
  torn down. This needed no hand-assembled bytecode: ouroboros' own codegen
  emits `OP_SET_NAME` for a plain top-level `is`.

  **Stale snapshot.** The blocked-stub shadows were a snapshot taken at entry,
  so any name the host defined *after* the call had no shadow and stayed
  reachable through the parent link.

  **`import` is an opcode, not a name** — the allowlist never saw it. A
  sandboxed `OP_IMPORT` read any `.eigs` on the box (the request is built as
  `lib/<name>.eigs` with no validation, so `../` traverses out of the script
  tree), ran its body with the *full* builtin set, and handed back a dict of
  its functions, all while reporting `ok: 1`.

  The env is now a **sealed root**: `env_new(NULL)` with the allowlist copied
  in. There is no outer binding to write through to and no chain to fall
  through, so both the write-through and the snapshot staleness are closed
  structurally rather than patched. `import` is gated at the opcode alongside
  the name policy — any future opcode that touches the outside world needs the
  same gate. A callable in the result is refused (`{ok: 0, error: {kind:
  "sandbox"}}`), because a fn made inside closes over the sandbox env and the
  host would call it after the caps are restored; that scan is bounded by node
  count, not depth, since a self-referential list makes a depth-only bound
  exponential.

  In-ecosystem reachability is real: `iLambdaAi/lib/validate.eigs` grades
  model-generated code with `sandbox_run`.

- **`--pkg install` executed arbitrary commands from a lockfile (#714).**
  `eigs.json` / `eigs.lock.json` are data a repo hands us, and git parses a
  leading `-` as an option *even after positionals*. A lockfile carrying
  `"commit": "--upload-pack=<cmd>; git-upload-pack"` turned `cmd_install`'s
  `git fetch --depth 1 origin <commit>` into command execution — arbitrary code
  from `eigenscript --pkg install` alone, contradicting `lib/pkg.eigs`'s own
  header guarantee that no code from a package runs during install. The
  lockfile is exactly the artifact a supply-chain attacker edits. `run_git` now
  refuses any option-shaped argument that isn't one of the four literal flags
  the file itself passes — one chokepoint covering every call site, present and
  future, rather than sprinkling `--` separators and hoping each new one
  remembers. (The `ext::` transport-helper vector was also tested; git's own
  default `protocol.ext.allow=never` already blocks it.)

### Fixed

- **Every loop was silently broken at 100,000,000 cumulative in-frame
  iterations — wrong results with exit 0 (#772).** The sandbox iteration
  cap's default arm (`g_sandbox_loop_max ? … : 100000000`, in the
  stall-check/cap-check helpers and both VM opcode bodies) fired with no
  sandbox configured: on crossing 1e8 the running loop exited early with
  only `__loop_exit__ = "limit"` as a trace, the counter reset, and
  execution continued. Any program past 1e8 iterations computed
  "program + periodic loop truncation" — the overnight EigenMiniSat runs
  (~1e11 iterations) contained on the order of a thousand silent early
  exits each. Found on polymethod's first day by its full-vector
  brute-force differential (4 corrupted outputs in 524,288 at n=19;
  corrupted indices in the arithmetic progression the cap predicts;
  minimal repro: a loop to 1.5e8 stopped at exactly 1e8). The cap now
  fires **only** when a sandbox budget is explicitly armed
  (`sandbox_run`'s `max_iter`, unchanged and still covered by
  `test_vm_run_bytecode.eigs`); ordinary execution never truncates a
  loop. `EigsState.loop_iterations` / `CallFrame.saved_loop_iter` widen
  to `long long` — an uncapped frame can exceed `int` range, which was
  signed-overflow UB. Regression: suite [124]
  (`test_loop_cap_772.eigs`, a 1.05e8-iteration loop run to completion).
  SPEC's loop-termination passage updated to match.

- **The RSS leak gate called a one-off allocator step a leak, and it was the
  step that moves (#768, follow-up to #765).** #765 made the gate judge the
  *second* of two measured batches, on the premise that the process's one-time
  memory cost is front-loaded and therefore spent by then. It is not. Every
  connection is served by a fresh `EigsState` on its own thread, so the first
  time two workers' lifetimes overlap, glibc allocates a second per-thread
  malloc arena and RSS steps by roughly one worker's footprint — ~2.7 MB, once,
  after which arenas are recycled and RSS is flat. That overlap is scheduled by
  wall clock, not by request count: on the dev box the step lands at request
  400, 500, 600 and 700 across four identical runs, and on a slower CI runner it
  lands past 3000 — inside the batch #765 had just made the verdict. Run
  30439602640 failed that way (2876 kB, "first batch 0 kB") while attempt 2 of
  the same commit passed. It was never a leak: a 24,000-request soak grows 0 kB
  after warmup, which bounds any real per-request leak at <3 B/req against the
  1472 B/req reported. The tell was already in the failure text — a leak of
  1472 B/req cannot be absent from the immediately preceding identical batch.
  The gate now runs three measured batches and judges their **median**, so one
  step, wherever it lands, moves at most one of the three while a real leak
  moves all three. The threshold is unchanged at 64 kB. The verdict rule is a
  pure function of the three numbers and is now self-tested against ten planted
  faults on every run (both historical leak rates, the step in each of the three
  positions it can land in, and a leak with a step on top); the rule was also
  validated end-to-end against a real 256 B/req heap leak planted in
  `shared_incr`, which it reports as 272 B/req with all three batches grown.
  That last check matters more than it looks: the first fault planted to
  validate it — dropping a `val_decref`, the literal #731 shape — left the gate
  green. That is not because the fault is harmless. It leaks 72 heap bytes per
  request (probed: `g_arena.active=0`, `new_v->arena=0`, so it is not an
  arena-served Value), and at 20,000-request batches it shows as ~145 B/req
  sustained and unbounded. The gate misses it because its whole decision happens
  inside the first 7,000 requests, which for that rate is still inside the window
  where the leak is absorbed by resident free heap the process already owns. So
  the gate remains blind to a real leak of the exact class it is the sole
  instrument for — tracked as #770, with exact allocator accounting
  (`mallinfo2().uordblks`) as the proposed replacement for the RSS proxy. A gate
  this class depends on has to be shown turning red by something that actually
  leaks, and this one only turns red for some of them.

- **Four more process-globals that contradict the multi-state contract (#739
  item 4).** Each is a resource the runtime scopes per state or per thread
  everywhere else, held in one process-wide slot:
  - `s_osr_threshold` (`vm.c`) was a *function static* filled by whichever
    state crossed a back edge first and then frozen for the life of the
    process, defeating the per-state JIT tuning `eigenscript.h` explicitly
    advertises ("so two co-located embedded states can tune independently") —
    entry and iter thresholds were already per-state; only OSR opted out. It
    now reads `g_osr_threshold` directly. `eigs_jit_get_osr_threshold()`
    existed only to fill that cache and is deleted; its comment claimed it was
    read "once per thread", which was never true — it was once per process.
  - `g_sandbox_active` / `g_sandbox_bytes_used` / `g_sandbox_byte_max` /
    `g_sandbox_loop_max` are now per-thread. The save/restore in
    `builtin_sandbox_run` is correct for one thread's nesting, but the premise
    it documented — "sandbox_run is synchronous" — holds *per thread* and
    breaks the moment two states run concurrently, which `ext_http` does per
    connection: one worker entering a sandbox capped every other worker's
    loops and charged their allocations against its budget.
  - `g_stream_file` is now per-thread and closed at `eigs_thread_detach`. One
    `FILE*` per process meant `stream_open`'s unconditional close tore down
    another state's in-flight stream, and an unclosed stream lost its buffered
    tail at exit rather than being flushed.
  - `g_db_conn` moved onto `EigsState`, closed by a new `ext_db_state_destroy`
    called from `eigs_state_destroy` — the same shape `ext_http_state_destroy`
    already had. Previously one worker's `db_connect` replaced the connection
    another worker was querying through, and nothing ever closed it.

  `g_model` was deliberately left process-wide. Its allocations are reachable
  from a global at exit, so they are still-reachable rather than leaked; the
  real defect would be cross-state clobber, and per-state transformer weights
  would multiply memory by the number of states. That is a design decision
  about model isolation, not a mechanical scope move.

- **A `task_yield` on one thread silently made every other thread return `null`
  (#739 item 3).** The cooperative scheduler lives on `EigsThread` — tasks are
  single-threaded by construction — but the suspend request that drives it was
  a plain global, set at four sites and polled by every `vm_run` on every
  thread at `CASE(CALL)`. So a `task_yield` on the main thread drove an
  unrelated OS worker's next call into `vm_suspend_halt`. Having no scheduler
  of its own, the victim's `task_save_slice(task_current_running())` was handed
  NULL and saved nothing, and `vm_run` returned NULL mid-evaluation with its
  frames deliberately undrained (the suspend path preserves them on purpose) —
  so a spawned worker silently produced `null` instead of its result. Measured:
  a worker computing 400000 returned `null` on 3 of 3 runs while main was
  yielding, and 400000 on 3 of 3 with the identical program minus the yields.
  The flag is now per-thread. It sits on `EigsThread` beside the `task_sched`
  it drives rather than inside `TaskScheduler` as first sketched, so the hot
  `CASE(CALL)` poll stays a single load off the already-hot `eigs_current`
  with no NULL check for the (overwhelmingly common) no-scheduler thread.
  `tests/test_tasks.eigs` covers it; the suite had no case where cooperative
  tasks and OS threads ran at the same time.

- **One `exit of N` permanently disabled `try`/`catch` for the rest of the
  process (#739 item 2).** `exit` is deliberately uncatchable: `builtin_exit`
  sets `g_exit_requested` and `CHECK_ERROR` consults it to refuse routing the
  unwind to a `try` handler. But the flag was a **process global that nothing
  ever reset** — not `eigs_close`, not `eigs_state_destroy`, and `main` leaves
  it set on purpose. So once any script in any state called `exit`, every later
  `eigs_eval_string` in the process ran with exception handling silently off: a
  raise inside `try` went to `vm_error_halt` instead of the catch handler. For a
  long-lived embedder running untrusted snippets — the `sandbox_run` case, and
  the seam EigenOS M11 consumes — one line of script corrupted the semantics
  permanently. Unreachable from the CLI, where `exit` ends the process, which is
  why it had never been seen. `g_exit_requested`/`g_exit_code` now live on
  `EigsThread` beside the `g_has_error`/`g_try_depth` they are read with, and
  the request is cleared at host eval entry, so it applies to the eval that
  raised it and no later one. `exit` stays uncatchable and still returns its
  code from the CLI and the REPL. The exit **code** is additionally latched on
  the `EigsState`: per-thread alone would have silently dropped `exit of N`
  inside a *spawned worker* to 0 while `main` returned success, so the thread
  flag drives the uncatchable unwind and the state latch decides the process's
  status — which also means a worker's exit no longer erases a genuine
  main-thread error. `tests/test_exit.sh` covers the worker case; the embed
  smoke harness covers the try/catch recovery with a before-exit control.

- **Every HTTP connection worker tore down the process trace tape, so the tape
  died after the first request (#739).** `trace_shutdown()` is a process-wide
  teardown — it closes the one tape, drops an embedder's trace sink, and shuts
  down the replay reader — and `ext_http.c`'s per-connection worker called it
  when it finished a request. Each worker owns its own `EigsState`, but the
  tape belongs to the process, so the *first* request served closed it and
  every later request's records were silently dropped. Measured on the
  unfixed runtime: **one record for four hundred requests**, with the server's
  tape fd already closed; after the fix, 336 records had reached disk mid-run
  and the fd was still open. The same teardown freed the temporal prev-table,
  running `slot_decref` on entries recorded by other, still-live threads. The
  teardown is now split: `trace_shutdown()` keeps the process-wide half, and a
  new `trace_thread_release()` releases only the calling thread's history —
  called by `eigs_thread_detach` for every thread, so the HTTP worker no longer
  touches the trace subsystem at all. The prev-table moved onto `EigsThread`
  behind bridge macros, which is the scope it always effectively had: it is
  keyed by *interned name pointer* and the intern table is per-thread, so two
  threads' `x` were never the same key — process-global storage bought nothing
  and cost ownership. It needs no lock, since only the owning thread touches
  its table. The tape encoding is untouched, so no format-version bump — this
  was an ownership bug, not a format one. (Corrects one premise in the issue:
  cross-state history reads were *not* possible, because pointer-keying already
  separated them.)

- **`http_post` silently sent NO headers when `headers` was a JSON object
  (#755).** The documented signature is `http_post of [url, headers, body]`,
  and an object is the shape a caller reaches for first — but the code tested
  `VAL_LIST` while `eigs_json_parse_object` returns a `VAL_DICT`, so the loop
  never ran and the request went out bare. No error, no warning, a normal
  response body: an `Authorization` header silently not sent. Only the flat
  alternating array form worked, and `docs/BUILTINS.md` never said which shape
  was expected. Both shapes are accepted now, and a headers argument that
  parses to neither raises `type_mismatch` instead of quietly dropping them
  (an unparseable argument, including `""`, still means "no headers" — the
  documented idiom). BUILTINS.md now states the accepted shapes.

- **`report` labelled a still-moving value "equilibrium" at a full window,
  violating the agreement guarantee it documents (#735).** `report of x`
  resolves the six windowed bands in priority order and then, if none is true,
  falls back to an instantaneous label read off the last `dH` alone. That
  fallback exists for a *partial* window — where the full-window predicates are
  false by rule and `report` still has to say something — but it was never
  gated on `count < N`, so it also ran at a full window. The bands are not
  exhaustive: a full window of steady gray-band drift at *low* entropy fires
  nothing (every step under `dh_small` excludes improving/diverging by the #187
  rule, a mean over `dh_zero` excludes equilibrium/converged, and `stable`
  requires `entropy >= h_low`), and every such window was reported
  `equilibrium`. A decaying residual — `d is d * 0.5`, twenty times — is in
  exactly that state, so a convergence loop written the way `PREDICATES.md`
  recommends, keyed on `report`, exited early at rc=0 with a plausible answer.
  `docs/PREDICATES.md:328-335` states the opposite guarantee explicitly and
  names the partial window as the only exception; found by an agent that
  reimplemented the published formulas as an independent oracle, which
  confirmed the six predicates were right and `report` was wrong. The fallback
  is now gated on a partial window, and a full window with no band true reports
  **`moving`** — the residual label the value channel already uses for this
  state, so both channels answer "not settled, not in any named band" the same
  way. The invariant (at a full window, `report` names a band whose predicate
  is true, or `moving`) is now asserted in `tests/test_predicate_matrix.eigs`
  across every full-window shape; it had been prose only, which is why this
  survived. `lib/experiment.eigs` was relying on the wrong answer: all five of
  its analyzers seeded `tracker is 0` *observed*, putting a synthetic
  `0 -> values[0]` entropy jump in the first window, and
  `is_measurement_stable` scored ten identical readings as stable only because
  the fallback overrode the resulting window. The sentinel is now seeded inside
  `unobserved:`, so the trajectory is the data. The cross-repo observer corpus
  (#262) caught the consumer-visible half and is the best evidence the fix is
  right: `dynamics`' Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and PageRank solvers all drive
  `status is report of change` and stop on `"equilibrium"`, so all three were
  terminating early on the false label — Jacobi at 14 iterations and
  `0.9999995231628418`, now 21 and `0.9999999997671694`; Gauss-Seidel 11 → 18;
  PageRank 27 → 32. A real downstream solver was silently returning a
  less-accurate answer. Three goldens were recaptured for that reason (the
  other eleven programs are byte-identical).

- **Observer papercuts: a discarded query was silent, `state_at` leaked a
  runtime-internal binding, and two doc rows had gone stale (#736).** Four
  small independent defects on the observer surface, from the same review as
  #735. (1) A bare `report of x` as a *statement* evaluates the query and
  throws the answer away — nothing printed, nothing raised, exit 0. `W019`
  already covered the interrogatives (`where is x`, `prev of y`); it now covers
  the query special forms over an ident (`report`/`report_value`/`observe`/
  `trajectory`) too. It stays zero-false-positive: over an ident those are
  compiler-resolved and never reach a user function even when one shadows the
  name (#459), and a non-ident argument is an ordinary call the check never
  sees. This was the worst affordance the observer had — silence reads as "the
  observer had nothing to say", and the bare form is the one issue bodies and
  READMEs reach for. (2) `state_at of <line>` returned `__loop_exit__` in its
  user-visible dict; the observed-loop machinery's own bindings are now
  filtered from it and from `--step`'s bindings pane (an explicit
  `p __loop_exit__` still answers, and the tape's binding count stays honest).
  (3) `docs/SYNTAX.md` still described `how` as degenerate, returning 0 with 1
  only at zero *entropy*; #412 made it a real gradient
  (`1 - min(1, |dH| / dh_zero)`, settledness of the last step). (4)
  `docs/PREDICATES.md` still claimed entropy is exactly `0` at `|x| ∈ {0, 1}`;
  #412 deleted the `|x| == 1` special case, so unity is the *maximum* — the
  horizon — and only `0` is the home point. That one was stale in the maximally
  confusing direction: 0 vs 1 is the difference between "fully converged" and
  "maximally undecided". A worked `at` example inside a loop was also added,
  since "the last assignment at or before this line" answers with the loop's
  final pass, which is exactly where the rule stops matching intuition.

- **`ext_http.c` leaked a `Value` on three request paths (#731).** Every
  `eigs_json_parse_value` call site in the file was audited after #731 reported
  the first; three of five leaked. `shared_incr` dropped two per call — the
  parsed counter on *both* the success and the type-mismatch early return, plus
  the `make_num` handed to `eigs_json_encode`, which borrows rather than takes
  ownership. `builtin_http_post` never released the parsed headers object, and
  `http_route_authed`'s shared-store auth branch never released the parsed
  `require_auth` string. The last two were found by auditing the class rather
  than the instance, and are per-request leaks on the same footing as the
  reported one. Measured on a release build against a live server: `shared_incr`
  159 B/req → **0**, an authenticated route 188 B/req → **0**.

  Gated by `tests/test_http_rss_growth.sh` (suite [45c]), which measures RSS
  growth between two steady-state checkpoints. This shape is deliberate: no
  sanitizer can catch this class here, because LeakSanitizer reports from an
  `atexit` handler and the test server is torn down with `kill` against no
  SIGTERM handler — the ASan suite reported 32/32 green over the leak for as
  long as it existed. The gate skips itself on a sanitizer build, where ASan's
  own redzones and quarantine produce 567 B/req of growth on a *fixed* binary
  and would swamp the signal. Threshold validated by planting the fault back:
  both checks fail without the fix and pass with it (#752).

- **`continue` never ended its loop iteration's env, silently truncating a
  module's exports (#722).** `AST_BREAK` emits `OP_LOOP_ENV_END` before its
  jump when the loop allocated a per-iteration env — the pairing #335's
  double-free motivated — but `AST_CONTINUE` emitted only the back-jump. The
  back-edge target sits *before* the per-iteration `OP_LOOP_ENV_FRESH`, so the
  env was never torn down: each `continue` nested another env under the live
  one, and a `continue` on the final iteration left `frame->env` pointing at
  the loop env for everything that followed. Visibly, the loop variable
  outlived its loop (lint E003 documents reading it after the loop as a runtime
  error). Silently — and far worse — a module whose top-level loop contains a
  `continue` executed every later definition in that leaked loop env instead of
  the module env, so none of them reached the export dict: the import reported
  success and the module's API was simply missing everything after the loop.
  The fix mirrors `break`, under the same `has_fresh_env` gate (the env-skip
  path has no env; the persist path ends its single reused env at the loop
  exit, which is why an unguarded emit would have torn down the surrounding —
  often global — env of a `loop while`). Only reproducible when something in
  the body captures the loop variable, since that is what forces the
  fresh-env-per-iteration path.

- **`--fmt` split multi-char operators, so `--write` corrupted the source
  file (#729).** The formatter's spacing pass is character-level, and its
  multi-char operator table knew only `==`, `!=`, `<=` and `>=`. Everything
  else fell through to the single-char branches, which append a space after
  `+` and around `<`/`>`: `x += 1` became `x + = 1`, `x <<= 2` became
  `x < <= 2`, `>>` became `> >`, `=>` became `= >`, `|>` became `| >`, and the
  exponent in `1.5e+10` became `1.5e + 10`. Under `--fmt --write` that was
  written back over the user's file — a working program destroyed in place by
  the tool whose job is to leave it working. 31 of the repo's own `.eigs`
  files, `lib/checksum.eigs` among them, stopped parsing after being
  formatted. `-=`, `&=`, `|=` and `^=` escaped only because `-`, `&`, `|` and
  `^` happen to be in neither branch. The operator table is now the lexer's
  full set, matched longest-first and emitted atomically, and a numeric
  literal's exponent sign is no longer read as an operator. The suite gained
  the assertion that was missing rather than a case per operator: every
  `.eigs` in the repo that parses before `--fmt` must still parse after it —
  the formatter was already *idempotently* wrong, so idempotence alone never
  caught this.

- **Leaving a `try` by `break`, `continue`, or `return` did not unregister its
  handler (#726).** The compiler emitted `OP_TRY_END` only at the *normal* end
  of a try body, so every non-local exit jumped out with the handler still
  live — and the failure was silent in three different ways. After a `break`
  out of a `try`, a later error resolved to that dead handler: execution
  re-entered the already-finished catch body with a stale `catch_bp`, and the
  env restored from the wrong frame lost its bindings (the repro's next line
  reported `undefined variable 'print'`). `continue` was worse — it re-entered
  `TRY_BEGIN` every iteration while its `TRY_END` never ran, so the handler
  stack climbed once per iteration until it pinned at the cap. And `return`
  from inside a `try` leaked the *process* global `g_try_depth`, whose
  `== 0` gate in `rt_error` is what decides whether an uncaught error prints
  at all: after one such return, every later uncaught error in the process
  exited nonzero with **no diagnostic whatsoever**. All three now emit one
  `OP_TRY_END` per try block being left, the way `break` already emitted the
  loop-env cleanup.

  The originally-reported half of the same issue — nesting *past* the 8-deep
  per-frame handler stack — was a mis-pair rather than a leak: `TRY_BEGIN`
  registered nothing while its `TRY_END` still popped, so from the 9th `try`
  onward every raise took the wrong catch, with no error and no warning (9
  nested tries caught at depth 7). Deeper nesting is now a compile error the
  way a stray `break` is (#337), and `TRY_BEGIN` re-checks at runtime and
  raises, because an untrusted chunk reaches it without a compiler in the
  path. 8-deep still dispatches to the innermost catch.

- **Builtins called from outside the VM freed live values (#720).** A builtin
  may return a *borrow* of its argument with no compensating incref — `num`
  returns its argument unchanged for `VAL_NUM`, `sort` returns its arg, and
  `append` / `dict_set` / `set_at` / `coalesce` return their target. The VM's
  three call sites compensated for this; the three that call a builtin from
  outside the dispatch loop did not, and returned the raw result. So the
  natural "sort numerically" idiom —

  ```eigenscript
  xs is [3, 1, 2]
  r is sort_by of [xs, num]
  ```

  printed `[4.36961373427899e-310, 4.36961373428453e-310, 0]` instead of
  `[1, 2, 3]`: `sort_by` hands the key function a *borrowed* list element,
  `num` hands it straight back, and `sort_by`'s own decref then dropped the
  list's reference to every element in turn. A silent wrong answer in release
  and a heap-use-after-free under ASan. Three distinct instances, each with a
  confirmed repro: `call_eigs_fn` (`sort_by`, and the gradient helpers'
  loss-function calls), `thread_entry` (`spawn of [append, xs, 5]` and
  `spawn of [num, 42]` — the second freeing the worker's own return value),
  and `builtin_dispatch` (the C fallback reached when `dispatch` is called
  indirectly; a direct call compiles to `OP_DISPATCH`, which was correct).

  The protocol now lives in one place — `vm_borrow_compensate` in `vm.c`, used
  by all six sites — with the two halves written down: a builtin returning a
  borrow *deeper* than a direct child increfs it itself (as `get_at` always
  did), which is what makes the call sites' capped direct-child scan
  sufficient rather than a guess; and the `caller_owns_arg` flag distinguishes
  the VM's contract (`result == arg` transfers the ref) from the out-of-VM one
  (the caller only borrows `arg`, so identity needs an incref too). Found by
  full-repo review, not by the suite: `num` is explicitly accepted as a
  `sort_by` key, but no test had ever paired a borrow-returning builtin with
  an out-of-VM call site, and the #548 borrow guard only instruments the VM
  path.

- **`free_val` consumed a reference it did not own.** Same review, same three
  sites, opposite direction: `free_val` is the runtime's one *consuming*
  builtin, and where the argument was only borrowed it dropped the caller's
  reference — `sort_by of [xs, free_val]` raised correctly and left `xs`
  pointing at freed elements. Those sites now lend it a reference of their own.

- **A release-build regression in the borrow protocol would not have been
  counted.** Suite section [119] short-circuited on the `SKIP:` line that the
  sanitizer-only #548 guard emits on release builds, discarding every other
  result in the block — including failures. The tally is now derived from the
  block's own `PASS:`/`FAIL:` lines (#654's rule) and a skip is reported
  without suppressing the count.

- **`lib/pkg.eigs` crashed in its own git-failure handler.** `of` binds tighter
  than `+`, so `print of "  " + (join of [cmd, " "])` parsed as
  `(print of "  ") + (join ...)` and threw "cannot apply '+' to null and str" —
  a failed git command reported the wrong error and never named the command
  that failed.

### Changed

- **`tests/test_http_server.sh` no longer reports a setup failure as a feature
  failure (#760).** `HS27`/`HS28` failed one CI run with "aggregate body budget
  (got 000)" — a DoS-gate regression that had not happened. Both checks had
  simply received *empty* responses, because the server was never reachable.
  Three defects, each measured: the listen port was drawn from `50000-59999`,
  entirely inside the kernel's ephemeral range (`32768-60999` on Linux), so the
  suite's own `curl` clients could hold the port the next server tried to bind;
  the readiness loop's real budget was **3.58s**, not the ~33s its
  `--max-time 1` implied, because a refused connection returns instantly; and
  neither failure was detected, so the test proceeded against a server that
  was not there and the log naming the real cause was written to `/tmp` and
  never read. There is now a shared `pick_port` (below the ephemeral floor,
  read from `/proc` where available) and a `wait_ready` with a wall-clock
  deadline, and a server that never comes up fails as a **setup** failure
  quoting its own log. The main server in the same file had both defects too
  and now uses the helpers.

- **`make asan-http` puts the HTTP + model extensions under a sanitizer for the
  first time, and CI runs the suite that way.** `make asan` compiles those
  extensions out, so `ext_http.c` — a network-facing server and client, the most
  exposed code in the repo — had never been compiled into any sanitizer build,
  local or CI. That is the structural reason #239's remote DoS reached `main`
  through a green CI. The suite's HTTP sections are probe-gated on `http_route`,
  so the new variant pulls them in with no test changes. Scoped to the `http`
  variant rather than `full` deliberately: `ext_db.c` needs libpq headers, which
  would make the target unbuildable without postgres — so ext_db remains
  unsanitized. This gate catches use-after-free, buffer overflow and UB, which
  report at the moment of the bug; it does **not** catch per-request leaks,
  because LeakSanitizer runs atexit and the test server is torn down with `kill`
  against no SIGTERM handler. That class needs an RSS-growth measurement (#731).

- **The observer's entropy walk now stops at a reference (#685).** A list or
  dict computes entropy over its own elements; an element that is itself a
  container contributes only its size term `log2(count+1)` and is not entered.
  This is the rule buffers and text builders always followed — they hold raw
  bytes and doubles, so there were never child values to recurse into — and a
  dict holding a 5-element list now measures exactly as one holding a
  5-element buffer.

  An observed assignment therefore costs the value's *own* size, never
  everything it can reach. The reported case (a short-lived binding
  referencing a large live structure) went from 4.93s to 0.049s at N=8000 and
  is linear in N rather than merely faster. Cyclic and shared object graphs
  are well-defined because they are never traversed, so #571's visited set and
  the depth-64 cap are removed rather than ported.

  **This is a semantics change**: a container's entropy no longer reflects the
  contents of what it points at, only that thing's size. It could not
  meaningfully reflect them before — nothing re-observes a binding when a
  referenced structure is mutated in place, so a reachability-wide reading
  went stale on the first such write (measured at 6.2M mutations onto
  already-summarized values per fleet run). Flat containers, scalars and
  trajectories are unchanged; only reference-bearing values move.

- **`json_raw` values are measured instead of reported as 0 (#709).**
  `VAL_JSON_RAW` holds the same `data.str` a string does, but the entropy walk
  returned a flat `0.0` for it — so a `json_raw` document could grow without
  bound while the observer reported entropy 0, dH exactly 0, and classified it
  `equilibrium`. It now shares the string byte-frequency entropy.

  The walk's `switch` also lost its silent catch-all: it has no `default:` and
  no trailing fallthrough value, and the build gains `-Werror=switch`, so a new
  value type is a compile error at that switch rather than a plausible-looking
  `0.0`. `VAL_FN` still returns a constant `1.0` — tracked as #708.

- **Bytecode chunk descriptors now carry an ABI revision (#704).**
  `vm_run_bytecode` and `sandbox_run` take
  `[abi, code, constants, functions?, param_count?, name?, local_names?]`, where
  `abi` is the `EIGS_BYTECODE_ABI` (currently `1`) the producer was built
  against. A missing or mismatched revision raises (kind `value`) — or, through
  `sandbox_run`, returns `{ok: 0}` with a message naming the revision — instead
  of executing. Nested function descriptors are unchanged and carry no stamp.

  This closes the half of the bytecode ABI that was never guarded. Opcode
  *numbers* have had a `_Static_assert` guard since #262; operand *widths* had
  nothing, so v0.33.0 widening `OP_LINE` 16→32 bits (#630) renumbered no opcode,
  kept every upstream guard green, and still misaligned every external
  producer's chunks — ouroboros emitted empty output for all 44 parity programs
  at exit 0 with its byte-comparing `bootstrap fixed point` still passing, and
  iLambdaAi's grading ladder silently lost its top rung. Consumers pin a
  release, so their CI structurally cannot warn before the bump. A stale
  producer is now refused by name.

  Bump `EIGS_BYTECODE_ABI` (src/vm.h) on any opcode renumbering, mid-enum
  insert, or operand-width change; appending a new opcode at the end does not
  need one. Producers hardcode the revision as a literal — a producer that read
  the runtime's current value back would always agree, which is why no builtin
  exposes it.

  **Breaking for external bytecode producers**, which must add the stamp:
  `ouroboros/src/codegen.eigs` and its vendored copy
  `iLambdaAi/lib/ouro_codegen.eigs`, landing with their `EIGS_REF` bump.
  Also breaking in one smaller way: a non-list descriptor now raises instead of
  returning `null`.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-07-24

The **silent-wrong-answer release**, plus the primitives the app fleet forced.
Two threads run through it. The first is a sweep of the highest-yield failure
class — a plausible-but-wrong value returned at rc=0, where nothing warns and
nothing crashes: `regex_match` deleting every capture after a non-participating
group (#629), `json_decode` silently truncating long numbers by 50 orders of
magnitude (#628), four stdlib math functions returning confidently wrong numbers
(#638-#641), a module's top-level assignment rebinding its *importer's* global
(#673), a comprehension variable and a same-named local splitting into two
bindings so program text after a statement changed that statement's result
(#633/#642), and the observer itself calling a converging sequence `diverging`
(#674) while its learning-rate gate certified a still-moving system as settled.
The second is the primitive layer: four DEFLATE codecs (#684), a tape-captured
`clock_unix` (#683), and four C-backed list operations (#543/#544) — every one
of them requested by a consumer that had hit the wall (`.xlsx` import, `TODAY()`,
interpreter-speed list scans) rather than speculated. `kill -USR1` now makes a
running process report how each of its bindings is progressing (#660), and the
test runner learned to distrust itself: it fingerprints the binary mid-run,
bounds every block against a runaway, and derives its own tally from block
output after the hand-synced literals were caught under-reporting by 169
asserts (#654).

**Upgrade notes.** Two changes are observable from outside. (1) `OP_LINE`'s
operand widened from 16 to 32 bits (#630), which breaks any external producer
of bytecode — see the entry below; `ouroboros` and `iLambdaAi` needed a
downstream emitter fix. (2) `regex_match` now emits null for a
non-participating capture group and continues, where it previously truncated
the result there (#629) — correct per the documented "group n at index n"
invariant, but code that consumed the truncated shape (such as EigenRegex's
`compat_match` shim, which mirrored it deliberately) needs updating.

### Added
- **DEFLATE codecs: `inflate` / `deflate` / `zlib_inflate` / `zlib_deflate`
  (#684).** Four thin wrappers over the system zlib, two dual pairs. `inflate`/
  `deflate` are raw DEFLATE (windowBits -15) — the ZIP member format, so
  `.xlsx`/`.ods` entries are readable from script; `zlib_inflate`/`zlib_deflate`
  are zlib-wrapped, and the inflate side auto-detects zlib *and* gzip headers
  (windowBits 15+32), which is what makes a plain `.gz` readable. Byte
  representation mirrors `read_bytes`/`write_bytes` exactly: a list of ints
  0-255 or a buffer in, a fresh list of ints 0-255 out. Corrupt or truncated
  input raises a catchable `value` error rather than crashing, and decompressed
  output is capped at 256 MiB — a zip-bomb bound matching the `sandbox_run`
  default budget. The zero-dependency minimal build is preserved through the
  existing `EIGENSCRIPT_EXT_*` gate (default OFF, `make zlib` opts in, same
  pattern as `make http`): compiled without zlib the four names stay
  *registered*, so scripts can feature-detect with try/catch and the
  fail-closed sandbox allowlist can name real builtins, but every call raises
  "compiled without zlib support". All four are pure bytes-to-bytes and join
  `SANDBOX_ALLOW`. `tests/test_inflate.eigs` (22 checks) covers round-trip
  identity for both pairs including empty and 8 KB inputs, plus fixed known
  vectors; CI runs them for real on a `make zlib` leg (#697) instead of the
  probe-gated stub.
- **`clock_unix` — a wall clock that still replays (#683).** Seconds since the
  Unix epoch, routed through the trace-tape nondeterminism seam
  (`eigs_trace_record_nondet` / `eigs_replay_take`), so a program that reads
  the time replays byte-for-byte from its tape. The standing tape-first rule
  applied to a new nondeterministic source: no untraced clock.
- **`list_index_of` and `list_contains` (#543); `list_insert_at` and
  `list_slice` (#544).** C-backed value search and range operations over lists,
  using the VM's structural `value_equals` — the same comparison `==` uses — so
  membership and index lookup no longer route a per-element closure call
  through the interpreter. `list_insert_at of [list, i, v]` is the dual of
  `list_remove_at`, `list_slice of [list, start, end]` the dual of `copy_into`,
  so reorder and range-copy stop being hand-rolled interpreter-speed loops.
- **`kill -USR1 <pid>` dumps the live observer state (#660).** Ask a running
  process how it is progressing: one row per live binding to stderr —
  `name | value | when=<assigns> | entropy=<H> | dH=<dH> | trajectory` — at the
  next loop safepoint. The `sigaction` handler (SA_RESTART, installed by the
  CLI) only sets a `volatile sig_atomic_t`; the dump itself runs in normal
  thread context at the loop-cap per-iteration check, so the idle cost is one
  flag test — unmeasurable on `bench_dmg_shape` (166ms -> 163ms, n=5 medians),
  hence no `EIGS_OBSERVE` gate. The first thread to see the flag dumps (atomic
  test-and-clear), covering module scope plus that thread's live call frame;
  the module walk takes the existing #607 `g_module_env_lock` under MT, no new
  locking scheme. Every row carries its assign count, so a fresh per-call
  binding (`when=1`) reads differently from a settled one — the silent-tolerance
  failure mode the issue was about. `env->assign_counts` alone cannot back that
  (the SET_LOCAL fast path never bumps it), so the dump prints
  `max(assign_counts, obs_age)`; unobserved slots say `unobserved` rather than
  borrowing a window-less verdict. Driven against a live process by
  `tests/test_sigusr1_dump.sh` with observable barriers rather than sleeps.
- **`native_train_step` batched causal-mask training path (~10.75x faster).**
  The transformer trainer (model extension, used by iLambdaAi) re-ran a full
  forward+backward over the growing prefix for *every* target position in a
  window — O(seq) redundant passes, since the attention is causal and each
  position's activations are prefix-length-independent. Replaced with one
  causal-masked forward + per-position losses + one backward: gradient-identical
  (proven by matching loss sequences to float precision from a common
  checkpoint) but ~10.75x less compute (179 -> 16.65 ms/window on the d=32/L=4
  model). `EIGS_TRAIN_PERPOS=1` restores the per-position path as the
  gradient-check oracle; `EIGS_TRAIN_PROFILE=1` prints the per-phase split. New
  regression test `test_native_train_gradcheck.sh` (suite [47c], model build)
  pins the two paths together forever.
- **W020: a lint for `unobserved:` blocks that provably do nothing (#655).**
  Fires when *every* assignment in the block targets a dict field or list
  element (`d.k is ...`, `xs[i] is ...`). Observer bookkeeping is gated on
  the named env path, so a dict field is never observed — vm.c calls it
  "untracked" — and there is nothing for the block to skip. This shape was
  a real optimisation once: the tree-walking `eval.c` gated the dict in-place
  fast path on `g_unobserved_depth`, so Tidepool's 2026-04-17 physics block
  genuinely bought a zero-allocation tick. NaN-boxing B-3a (2026-05-22) then
  made that mutation unconditional via `dict_set_cached_immediate` for DMG's
  register-write path, the gate went away, and every block of this shape
  silently became a no-op. Nothing regressed and nothing warned — which is
  the argument for a lint rather than a doc fix; our own README shipped the
  dead form as its headline example for two months. Conservative by
  construction: `g_unobserved_depth` is a global, so a **call** inside the
  block runs the callee unobserved too (verified: `when is y` inside a
  function reads 3 normally, 0 when called from inside a block) and
  suppresses the warning, as does any plain-variable assignment or
  name-binding form (`for` / listcomp / `catch` / `match`). Only a provably
  inert block fires.
- **W021: a hint for defines shadowing an un-imported stdlib function
  (#591).** Sibling of W013 (which covers compiled-in builtins) for the
  `lib/*.eigs` layer: when a file `define`s a function whose name matches a
  public stdlib function from a module it never imported — the repeated
  downstream hand-roll failure (`median`/`mean` while `lib/stats.eigs` ships
  both; `hex4`/`pad2` twice) — the linter nudges: `define 'median' shadows
  lib/stats.eigs 'median' (import stats to use it)`. The name table is
  scraped from the public top-level defines of the same `lib/` directories
  the import resolver searches. Name-only matching has false positives by
  construction, so W021 is the first **hint-severity** diagnostic: it prints
  (and shows in `--json` and the LSP, as a `Hint` squiggle) but never fails
  `--lint` under either `--lint-level`. Silent when the module is imported,
  when the linted file *is* the module, and when the name is also a builtin
  (W013's territory); respects `# lint: allow` and the eigs.json
  allow-list like every other code.
- **`log2` / `log10` in lib/math.eigs (#545).** Pure-EigenScript base-2 and
  base-10 logarithms over the `log` builtin, element-wise like the `log`
  they wrap (`log2 of [8, 4]` -> `[3, 2]`); domain follows that builtin's
  input floor at 1e-10, so x <= 0 needs no new edge case. Thanks to
  @Nitjsefnie for the implementation and tests.
- **`dialog` hosts children, and `file_dialog` (#575).** The last of the
  lib/ui gap series. `dialog` was title + message + buttons and could hold
  nothing: its renderer and hit-test knew no children, and `dispatch`'s
  modal branch called `_handle_dialog_click` directly — bypassing the hit
  test, the registry, hover and key routing — so a picker had to be a
  hand-rolled overlay panel re-implementing modality from scratch
  (DeslanStudio's `src/client/dialogs.eigs`).

  A dialog is now a container: `add_child of [dlg, w]` mounts any widget,
  positioned relative to the dialog's top-left. Rather than teach the
  special case about children, **the top modal simply becomes the root for
  the event** — so hit-testing, the registry walk, focus, hover and drag
  all run against the dialog's subtree by the ordinary path, while clicks
  outside it reach nothing behind. `push_modal` and `app_loop` lay the
  modal out (it is not in the root's tree, so the normal layout pass never
  reached it). Two things that were impossible now work: **typing into a
  widget inside a modal**, and **hover on the dialog's own buttons** —
  `hover_btn` was only ever set to -1 and read by the renderer, with
  nothing in between ever assigning it, because no mousemove could reach a
  modal at all.

  `file_dialog(id, w, h, title, start_dir, on_ok)` is the picker on top:
  `..` first, then directories, then files, each sorted; a directory
  navigates, a file fills the path box, `on_ok(fd, path)` fires on Open.
  An unreadable directory lists empty rather than throwing. The dialog's
  button geometry is now defined once (`_dialog_btn_rect`) instead of
  being recomputed by render and click separately.

- **`eigen_generate` accepts an optional 4th argument: `top_p` (nucleus
  sampling).** Keeps the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability
  reaches `p`, so the candidate set adapts to the model's confidence, rather
  than the fixed top-k=40 that admits 39 near-zero tokens where the
  distribution is sharp and truncates real choices where it is flat. Absent or
  outside `(0,1)` keeps the historical top-k path, so existing callers and
  their recorded numbers are unchanged. Tested by statistical signature rather
  than by comparing token sequences — generation draws from a global `rand()`,
  so two calls with the *same* policy already disagree on most positions (3/40
  identical), and an earlier version of the check "verified" top-p from 0/40
  matches, which the control shows is meaningless. Suite `[47e]` asserts a
  restrictive nucleus narrows the emitted candidate set. **Honest scope: this
  did not fix the repetition it was written for.** The model assigns its
  repeat-loop continuation p=0.987, so a 0.95 nucleus keeps exactly one token
  and changes nothing — the degeneracy is a genuine fixed point in the model,
  not a decoding artifact.
- **`eigen_eval_loss` — forward-only held-out cross-entropy (model build).**
  Scores one held-out window without a backward pass, weight update,
  requantise, or observer write, so evaluating a checkpoint never mutates it.
  This is the metric a language model should be *selected* on, and it did not
  previously exist: iLambdaAi ranked checkpoints on a generated-and-parsed
  rate at n=30, where a 20% score has a 95% interval roughly 8%-39%. That
  metric could not distinguish two models whose held-out perplexity differed
  by 7x (39.6 vs 5.76) — it scored both at an identical 60/300, because greedy
  decoding collapses onto frequency attractors regardless of model quality.
  A loss gives one datapoint per window on a continuous scale instead of 300
  binary trials. Pinned by suite `[47d]` against the property that an
  untrained model must score ln(vocab_size) — measured 7.004 against a
  predicted 7.011 at vocab=1109 — which simultaneously catches a missing
  max-subtraction (overflow to inf), a mis-indexed target, and sign errors.
- **`build_corpus`: lossless slot-mode identifier encoding (#675) and exact
  tokens for small integer literals (#678).** Both are optional args that stop
  the corpus builder from erasing the information a model would need. Frequency
  mode promoted the top-N identifiers and collapsed every other one onto a
  single fallback token — 45.7% of all identifier occurrences at top_n=256 on
  the 2026-07 ecosystem corpus. That is not a quality loss but an
  *expressiveness* loss: `total is total + items[i]` encodes as `<ident> is
  <ident> + <ident>[<ident>]`, so "assign the variable I just read" — the
  property separating well-formed output from correct output — is not statable,
  and no amount of training recovers it. Slot mode (6th arg) encodes local
  names losslessly by position. Separately, every numeric literal tokenized to
  one `TOK_NUM`, so `[1,2,3]` and `[0,0,0]` were indistinguishable; the 7th arg
  `int_count=N` gives exact tokens to integers `[0, N)`. That erasure was
  costly twice over: a specification written as assertions carried no
  information (`(f of 4) == 1` and `(f of 3) == 0` arrive identical, so a model
  graded on satisfying them has nothing to learn), and it manufactured
  degenerate repetition — 5.3% of the corpus sits inside a short literal cycle
  repeated 3+ times, essentially all of it routed through the collapsed literal
  tokens. Integers 0-31 are 76% of numeric-literal occurrences and 7.7% of the
  whole corpus.

### Changed
- **`+` on two lists now names the fix (#680).** `[1,2] + [3,4]` reported
  `cannot apply '+' to list and list` — correct but not actionable; a Python/JS
  prior lands here and has to guess the idiom. The message now prescribes it:
  `... (use 'append of [xs, v]' to add an element, or 'concat of [a, b]' to join
  two lists)`, mirroring the existing f-string hint for mixed-type concatenation.
  First of the prescriptive-error pass (#680) — errors at points where the
  language diverges from mainstream priors should teach the fix, for humans and
  AI alike. Regression: `test_error_extra.eigs` EE20b.
- **The observer learning-rate gate is now two-channel (entropy *and* drift).**
  `observer_matrix_scale` throttled a weight matrix to 0.5x whenever its
  entropy was quiet — but entropy is computed over one SGD step's worth of
  weight change, which is always far below thresholds calibrated for scalar
  convergence loops. Instrumented over 2,597 steps x 42 matrices it classified
  "stable" for **100.0%** of matrix-steps and emitted 1.0x **zero** times: an
  adaptive gate that was really a constant 0.5x drag, while the loss was
  demonstrably still falling (6.09 -> 0.54). The fix adds the motion channel
  the observer buffer never carried — relative drift `||grad|| / ||w||` — and
  releases the "stable" verdict when the weights are still moving. The two
  channels disagreed on 100% of matrix-steps and drift was right every time,
  so the gate now releases 99.6% and throttles only genuine oscillation (0.4%).
  Measured on a fixed checkpoint, 400 windows, identical seeds: entropy-only
  1.405 / 0.729 at steps 200/300 vs two-channel 0.976 / 0.553 — ~25% better
  loss, matching a fully-disabled gate while *retaining* the ability to throttle
  a matrix that genuinely settles. `EIGS_OBS_ENTROPY_ONLY=1` restores the old
  single-channel gate and `EIGS_OBS_SCALE_OFF=1` disables gating entirely, so
  all three arms stay available for A/B; `EIGS_OBS_DRIFT_EPS` tunes the
  release threshold (default 1e-3). This is the observer's own failure mode —
  a meter blind to slow motion certifying a moving system as converged — found
  by pointing the instrument at itself.
- **The test runner no longer trusts its own binary, its own liveness, or its
  own arithmetic.** Three integrity gaps closed in one pass, all of the shape
  "the suite reports success it did not earn":
  - **Mid-run rebuild detection (#681).** Every build variant writes to the
    same `src/eigenscript` path, so rebuilding while a suite runs silently
    swaps the binary underneath it. The runner now records cksum+size+mtime at
    start, re-checks at section boundaries and at the end, and aborts loudly
    on mismatch. Section `[99d]` swaps the binary from a background step and
    asserts the guard fires.
  - **Runaway guards (#648, #616, #651, #656).** `check_eigs_suite` ran each
    file with no timeout, so one infinite loop hung the whole suite until the
    CI hard limit instead of reporting a failure. A shared `$EIGS_TMO`
    (timeout -> gtimeout -> none, mirroring `[97]`) now wraps it and reports
    rc=124 as a named failure that lets subsequent blocks run; the budget is a
    deliberately generous 180s (`EIGS_TEST_TIMEOUT`) — a backstop, not a
    latency assertion, so it never fires on a slow-but-working test on the
    N3350. `[97]`'s own too-tight `timeout 60` is fixed in the same pass
    (`invariant_weak.eigs` is ~60.5s standalone under ASan). Section `[99c]`
    drives a genuinely non-terminating fixture through the real
    `check_eigs_suite` to prove the guard fires *and* is tallied exactly. The
    last unguarded interpreter call — `[60]` Terminal Builtins — got the same
    shape plus `</dev/null` (#656): it reads stdin, so any environment holding
    stdin open wedged the suite forever rather than failing.
  - **Derived tallies (#654).** 23 blocks hard-coded a "(N checks)" label and a
    `TOTAL/PASS += N` literal kept in sync by hand. The literals had drifted
    **169 asserts below reality** (headline 2890, true 3059) — and the same
    mechanism could as easily over-report, which would be a coverage lie. Each
    block's count is now parsed from its own output, with the historical
    literal as a documented fallback and a visible stderr NOTE whenever a
    self-reporting block falls back unexpectedly.
- **A docs-only fast lane in CI (#643).** A `.md`-only PR ran all 15 legs —
  ~10 minutes of a contributor's wall-clock, set almost entirely by one 8m36s
  ASan run, plus two macOS runners, a postgres service and the freestanding
  symbol gate, to prove a paragraph did not break the sanitizers. Both external
  contributions that week paid it in full. A `scope` job now diffs the PR
  against its base and guards the expensive *steps*. Steps rather than jobs is
  the only safe shape: `asan + ubsan (full suite)` is a required status check,
  and a required check that is SKIPPED never reports — GitHub treats
  never-reported as unsatisfied, so an `if:` on the job would block the merge
  forever. The jobs still run and report green in seconds.

### Fixed
- **`regex_match` deleted every capture after a non-participating group
  (#629).** The builtin used a fixed `regmatch_t[16]` and a loop whose
  *condition* tested `matches[i].rm_so >= 0`. POSIX sets `rm_so = -1` for a
  group that did not participate — an unmatched optional `(x)?` — so the first
  such group terminated emission and dropped every later capture:
  `regex_match of ["ab", "(x)?(a)(b)"]` returned `["ab"]` instead of the full
  match plus three groups. Independently, groups past 15 vanished silently (a
  17-group pattern returned 16 elements). Both broke the docs/BUILTINS.md
  invariant that group *n* sits at index *n*. The array is now sized from the
  compiled pattern (`re.re_nsub + 1`) through the overflow-guarded
  `xmalloc_array` — `re_nsub` is attacker-controlled through the pattern but
  POSIX-bounded — that count is passed to `regexec`, the allocation is freed on
  every path, and the participation test moved into the loop body, so a
  non-participating group emits null and the ones after it still arrive.
- **`json_decode` silently truncated long number tokens (#628).** A number
  token was capped at 63 chars while the scanner kept going, so the dropped
  tail vanished and `atof` parsed a wrong-magnitude prefix at rc=0: a
  zero-padded `1.<60 zeros>e50` decoded to `1` — off by 50 orders of magnitude
  — and a 70-digit integer to 1e62 instead of 1e69, diverging from the
  runtime's own lexer. The `numbuf` is gone: the scanner already validates the
  decimal JSON number grammar, so the token span is recorded and `strtod` runs
  directly over it, correct at any length. The existing early returns for
  malformed tails (`1e`, `1e+`, `1.`) are unchanged. `strtod` could only
  overrun the scanned token via a C99 hex-float `0x` prefix — JSON has no hex
  numbers, so the scanner stops at `x` — and that is guarded by verifying
  `endptr` landed on the scanned end, re-parsing the isolated span on any
  mismatch so the value stays tied to the grammar the scanner accepted.
- **`pad_left` / `pad_right` hung forever on an empty pad char (#637).** Both
  looped until the string reached `width`, growing it by the pad char each
  pass; an empty pad char never grows it, so `pad_left of ["x", 5, ""]` never
  terminated. The degenerate case now returns the string unchanged — the honest
  reading of "pad with nothing" — matching the empty-arg guards `capitalize`
  and `replace_all` already carry in the same file. Contract documented in
  docs/STDLIB.md, with regression tests plus the previously-missing `pad_left`
  normal-path coverage.
- **Four stdlib functions returned confidently wrong numbers (#638, #639,
  #640, #641).** Each produced a plausible-but-wrong value at rc=0 — the
  highest-yield failure class — and each fix ships with a regression test
  verified to fail on the pre-fix library.
  - `punnett_square`: Aa x Aa read 1:1:1:1 instead of the canonical 1:2:1. The
    heterozygous boxes "Aa" and "aA" are the same genotype but were keyed
    distinctly; genotypes are now canonicalized so they fold.
  - `power_iteration`: returned |lambda|, not lambda — it read the eigenvalue
    off `|w| = |A v|`, which drops the sign, so `diag(-5, 1)` reported 5, a
    number that is not an eigenvalue of that matrix at all. Now the Rayleigh
    quotient over the pre-update vector. Positive spectra are unaffected.
  - `correlation`: with mismatched lengths it paired `min(len)` elements but
    centered them on the **full**-list means, so unpaired tail elements
    corrupted the covariance. Centers on the paired prefix now.
  - Two degenerate-input contracts: `factorial` of a negative returned 1 (via
    `n <= 1`) though it is undefined — it now returns the 0 sentinel,
    impossible for a real factorial and matching `combinations`' convention —
    and `time_of_flight` could return a **negative** time when both roots of
    `x = v0 t + ½ a t²` are negative; it returns the smallest non-negative
    root, or the same 0 sentinel it already used for the no-real-root case.
- **An imported module's top-level assignment rebound the importer's global
  (#673).** A module's top-level `name is expr` walked `mod_env`'s parent chain
  and rebound a same-named global in the **importer's** scope instead of
  creating module state, so the module's own functions — and any later use in
  the importer — resolved to the wrong binding. This is the top-level
  counterpart of #373's function-write boundary, one level up: `import`'s own
  compile of a module's top-level statements now forces `OP_SET_NAME_LOCAL`,
  binding strictly within `mod_env`, gated by a compile-time flag set only
  around that call. `load_file` is untouched — it shares #373's
  function-boundary flag but never sets the new one — so its documented
  "top-level statements execute directly in the current scope" contract still
  holds, and docs/SPEC.md's module write boundary now states both rules
  explicitly.
- **A comprehension/`catch` name and a same-named assignment split into two
  bindings (#633, #642).** A comprehension variable and a `catch` name bind by
  name into the function env via `OP_SET_NAME_LOCAL`, but a plain `x is ...` of
  the same name is slot-promoted to `OP_SET_LOCAL`. The two never met: the env
  held one binding while the slot kept a stale value, so a slot read returned
  the pre-comprehension value, and #642's half corrupted the comprehension's
  own result — the body resolved `i` to the shadowed slot every iteration, so
  `[-2, -2, -2]` came back instead of `[2, 4, 6]`, rc=0 with every element
  wrong. Worse, `c->captured` was the only thing suppressing slot promotion, so
  adding any closure or interrogative that merely *mentioned* the name —
  anywhere in the body, never executed — flipped which binding an earlier read
  saw: program text after a statement changed that statement's result.
  Listcomp vars and catch names are now collected into a per-scope env-bound
  name set (the mechanism that already keeps for-loop vars off the slot path),
  routing a same-named plain assignment to `OP_SET_FN_NAME_LOCAL`. Thanks to
  @Nitjsefnie for the fix. Its tests could not see #642 — all four read the
  name *after* the comprehension — so SS20/SS20b now pin the body's own result
  and SS21 is the control in the other direction, since a fix that de-promotes
  too eagerly would break the ordinary comprehension.
- **Undefined behavior in the float-to-`long long` cast in `value_to_string`
  (#695).** The `VAL_NUM` case tested `n == (long long)n && fabs(n) < 2^53`,
  evaluating the cast in the left conjunct *before* the magnitude guard; for
  |n| >= 2^63 that conversion is UB (float-cast-overflow, flagged by
  UBSan/CodeQL). The conjuncts are swapped so the range check short-circuits
  and guards the cast; in-range behavior is unchanged. The observer dump's
  string scan got the same treatment — range-check before dereference, and a
  bounded truncation marker.
- **`test_proc_stream` 8a raced the child instead of waiting for it (#604).** A
  100k spin loop only *hoped* the child had been scheduled; under load it had
  not, and the write returned 5. It now waits for child exit — `proc_wait`
  waitpid()s the pid and leaves the parent's pipe fds open, so waiting before
  writing pins the intended property: EPIPE from a dead child, not EBADF from a
  closed handle.
- **Three stale documented contracts a reader would have coded against
  (#645).** `type`'s doc listed `"null"` as a return value, which
  `builtin_type` never produces — it returns `"none"` — so `if type of x ==
  "null":`, written straight from the doc, is silently and permanently false
  (SPEC.md's CI-gated example had pinned the truth while BUILTINS.md
  contradicted it); the four omitted types are now enumerated too. `buf_get`'s
  doc promised "0 on out-of-bounds" long after #502 deliberately made it raise
  `index_range`, so an unguarded scan loop written on that promise gets a hard
  abort. And SPEC.md's error-kind table, introduced as a **closed** set,
  omitted `deadlock` — which SPEC.md itself tells you to catch 350 lines later.
- **LSP `import ` completion offered 34 of 75 stdlib modules (#692).** The
  completion list was a hand-maintained array in `src/eigenlsp.c` that had
  fallen 41 modules behind `lib/` — every `ui_w_*` widget module, the whole
  science set (`physics`, `chemistry`, `biology`, `calculus`, `linalg`,
  `numerics`, `optimize`, `probability`, `geometry`, `earth_science`,
  `engineering`), `audio`, `utf8`, `sync`, `pkg`, and more were simply
  invisible in the editor. `tools/gen_lsp_stdlib_index.sh` (added by #590 for
  symbol completion/hover) now also emits `stdlib_modules[]`, and completion
  iterates that. The list is generated from the `lib/` **file set**, not
  derived from the `stdlib_docs` rows: a module whose defines are all private
  (`ui_layout`) or that declares none at top level (`text_builder`) has no
  docs rows but is still importable, so deriving it would have silently
  dropped 5 real modules — including one the old hardcoded list did offer.
  `tests/test_lsp.py` now asserts completion against the actual `lib/*.eigs`
  listing rather than a count, so a new module can never fall out again.
- **MT use-after-free: module-env observer-slot growth raced unlocked worker
  reads (#694).** `observer_slot_update_e` grew `env->obs` with a bare
  `realloc` + non-atomic pointer store while holding no lock, and the
  `report of` / `when is` / predicate opcodes read a chain-resolved env's
  `obs` array outside any lock. A worker reading a MODULE binding's observer
  slot concurrently with the main thread first-observing a NEW module binding
  therefore walked a freed array — the exact use-after-free class #607 fixed
  for `names`/`values`/`assign_counts`, which `obs` was never brought into.
  The window is narrow (module obs grows only on a binding's *first*
  observation, only on the main thread), which is why it never bit in
  practice. `obs` now follows the same #607 discipline: growth on a shared
  module env copies into a fresh block under `g_module_env_lock`, RETIRES the
  old one (freed at park/destroy) instead of freeing it, and publishes the
  pointer with a release store — then the cap, also release. Readers go
  through the new `env_obs_slot()` accessor, which loads cap *then* pointer
  with acquires; the reverse order would admit new-cap-with-old-block, an
  out-of-bounds read of the retired array. Single-threaded and thread-local
  frame envs keep the plain realloc and plain loads behind one
  predicted-false branch, so there is no cost off the MT path. New TSan
  regression `test_obs_mt_race.eigs` (in the `test_tsan.sh` race-free slice)
  reports 5 data races without the fix and 0 with it.
- **`report_value` no longer calls a monotone converging sequence
  `diverging` (#674).** The value channel's raw-step divergence test (#422)
  judged a window's steps "non-vanishing" when the recent half's mean
  magnitude was at least *half* the older half's — admitting any geometric
  decay with ratio `r^5 >= 0.5`, i.e. `r ≳ 0.871`, so `x *= 0.90` /
  `x *= 0.95` (every real iterative solver's operating regime) read
  `diverging` while converging to zero. A geometric decay's steps DO vanish
  — their sum converges — so the bar is now "not shrinking": the recent
  half must be at least the older half (minus 1e-9 of fp-rounding slack).
  Linear runaways (constant steps) and polynomial/geometric growth (growing
  steps) still read `diverging`; decaying approaches fall through to the
  relative verdicts and settle as `converged`. Regression test
  `test_report_value_convergence.eigs` (suite [50j3]) pins the issue repro
  (ratios 0.88/0.90/0.95 converge) against the genuine-divergence cases.
- **`file_exists` / `ls` / `mkdir` / `getcwd` / `exe_path` are now
  trace-recorded (#585).** These fs builtins predated the tape and ran live
  under `EIGS_REPLAY`: a program branching on `file_exists of p` replayed
  against the current filesystem, not the recorded one, so a tape recorded on
  one machine silently diverged on another (the closed-world hole #471 closed
  for `args`). Each is now wrapped with the `TAKE`/`RECORD` pair, so replay
  serves the recorded answer and never touches the live fs. `mkdir` is
  Recorded rather than #148-non-replayable — its success bit is pinnable by
  the tape — and under replay the `TAKE` short-circuits before `mkdir(2)`, so
  the recorded bit is served and the directory is not created a second time
  (replay does not re-run the write side effect). Replay tests in
  `test_replay.sh` mutate the fs between record and replay to prove the value
  comes from the tape; verified JIT on and off.
- **`prev of` now binds unary-or-tighter like every other `of` (#634).**
  `prev of x + 1` parsed as `prev of (x + 1)` — the operand parser used
  `parse_expression` where every other `of` uses `parse_unary` — and
  silently returned null. It is now `(prev of x) + 1`, matching the spec's
  Application rule. `prev of` also requires a variable name now: a non-name
  operand (literal, index/dot, parenthesised expr) has no assignment history
  and is a clean parse error instead of a silent null.
- **Source line numbers wrapped at 65536 (#630).** The `OP_LINE` bytecode
  operand was 16-bit, so every line the VM tracked was `line % 65536`. Two
  assignments 65536 lines apart collapsed onto one stamp and `what is x at L`
  returned the wrong value at rc=0; runtime-error/stack-trace lines and the
  trace-tape line context were also silently wrong past line 65535 (the
  regime generated programs reach). Widened to 32-bit; no opcode number
  changed. **Breaking for external bytecode producers**, which the original
  fix did not call out: any program that hands the VM a chunk it built itself
  — via `vm_run_bytecode` — must now emit a 4-byte `OP_LINE` operand. A 2-byte
  emission leaves the VM reading the next instruction's first two bytes as the
  high half of the line number and resuming misaligned, so the chunk executes
  as garbage **silently, at rc=0**. Caught by the pre-bump consumer sweep, not
  by CI: `ouroboros`'s self-hosted codegen (every behavioral-parity program
  produced empty output while the bootstrap fixed point still passed) and
  `iLambdaAi`'s grading ladder (every "runs" rung scored 1 instead of 2 — a
  grader that quietly lost the ability to award its top grade). Both are fixed
  downstream by emitting u32. Nothing upstream gates this class: consumers pin
  a release, so a mid-release operand-width change cannot fail their CI until
  the bump.
- **`relu`/`leaky_relu`/`softmax`/`log_softmax` returned a silent null on a
  scalar (#632).** `tensor_to_flat` reports 0 dims for a `VAL_NUM`, and the
  four did `if (!flat) return make_null()`, so the null poisoned downstream
  arithmetic far from the cause. Each now has a scalar fast path (the
  degenerate element-wise case), matching `sqrt`/`exp`/`log`.
- **A modal dialog blocked the mouse but not the keyboard (#631).** Keyboard
  focus never consulted `_ui.modal_stack`, so Tab could reach a widget behind
  an open dialog and Enter/Space would activate it — a confirmation dialog
  could fire the destructive action it guards. `dispatch` now rebinds to the
  top modal before routing keys, and `push_modal`/`pop_modal` scope the focus
  list to the dialog (which also makes a dialog's own children Tab-able, #575).
- **README's `unobserved` example showed the inert half of a real
  optimisation (#655).** Reported by email with a full repro. The section
  paired a dict-field example (`game.px is game.px + game.vx * DT`) with
  "the observer is skipped ... ~22% faster", and both halves were false for
  that shape — a dict field is never observed, and it is mutated in place
  with or without the block. The example was Tidepool's physics block
  distilled to the half that stopped doing anything (its other 7 named
  locals — `cx`, `drag`, `thrust` — are where its win lives). The ~22% is
  real but comes from named variables: iLambdaAi measured it end-to-end on
  an 18-hour training run, and all five of its blocks are named-variable
  only. Rewritten around a plain-variable accumulator with the measurement
  that shape actually produces (834ms -> 307ms, 2.7x, 2M iterations, n=5
  medians), plus the dict caveat and a note that the depth is global rather
  than lexical. Now enforced by W020.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-07-16

The **desktop-shell release**: lib/ui's gap series, closed. DeslanStudio's
port is the toolkit's first real consumer, and building a DAW shell on it
surfaced ten issues (#561–#577, #594) — the things a toolkit only learns
when an actual application leans on it. Seven were real and are fixed here;
three had already been fixed or shipped and were closed with the probe
output rather than re-fixed.

The theme is **the toolkit owning what the consumer had to hand-roll**:
keyboard through the public event door instead of trapped inside
`app_loop`, a quit seam instead of `exit of N` skipping teardown, dropdown
items that can actually be clicked, labels that measure themselves, grids
that don't shadow your model, and a `menu_bar` that owns its own z-order.

### Added
- **`menu_bar` — the desktop File/Edit/View strip (#565).** The toolkit had
  the pull-down half (`menu`, `show_menu`, click-away close) but no bar, so a
  shell hand-rolled one from a toolbar of title buttons and had to position
  each menu from a button's cached `_ax` (valid only after a `_layout` pass),
  add every `menu` LAST to the root's children so it would render above the
  content it overlaps, and keep the title-button and menu lists paired by
  hand. `menu_bar(id, x, y, w, menus)` — `menus` a list of
  `{"title", "items", "on_select"}` — owns the strip, the popup placement
  (clamped so a menu near the right edge opens inward), and the open/close
  state, including sliding across titles while open.

  Its pull-down is drawn by a `_render_popups` overlay pass after the tree
  walk and hit-tested by `_find_open_popup_at` before it, so it sits above
  whatever it covers regardless of where the bar sits in the tree — that
  z-order is the widget's job now, not the consumer's. Item selection reads
  the click's own y and is exempt from double-click detection, so the two
  traps behind #577 do not recur here.
- **`grid.owns_cells` — let the app own the pattern (#572).** Default 1
  keeps the old behavior (the widget flips `cells[r][c]` then calls
  `on_cell`). Set it 0 and mouse *and* keyboard report `(row, col)` without
  touching `cells`, so an app whose model is the source of truth — undo
  history, pattern switching, randomize — decides in `on_cell` instead of
  both sides keeping a copy that drifts. Surfaced by DeslanStudio's 4d drum
  panel, which had to overwrite `grid.cells` from its model after every
  click and every model-side change.
- **`grid.row_label_w` / `grid.row_label_scale` (#572).** The row-label
  gutter was hardcoded to `ax - 60` at scale 1, so long labels overflowed
  left and a grid at x < 60 clipped them off the window; DeslanStudio
  positions its grid at x=76 purely to make the hardcoded gutter land
  inside its panel. Both are now fields (defaults 60 and 1 preserve the
  historical rendering), and the label's vertical centering uses the real
  `text_height` of its scale rather than an assumed 7px.
- **`handle_key` — keyboard routing through the public event door (#563).**
  `app_loop`'s inline keydown block is now a public `handle_key of [root, ev]`
  that `app_loop` itself calls, and `dispatch` routes `keydown`/`keyup` to it.
  A headless consumer drives keys exactly like mouse instead of reaching for
  the private `_match_hotkey`/`_handle_text_key`/`_handle_focus_key` handlers,
  and the priority order (hotkeys > escape-pops-modal > open combobox >
  focused text input > focus navigation) is pinned by tests in one place
  rather than duplicated. Returns 1 when the toolkit consumed the key, 0 when
  it is free for the app — focus navigation reports its own consumption, so an
  unbound key with a widget merely focused is no longer silently swallowed.
  Surfaced by DeslanStudio milestone 4b, whose `tests/test_shell.eigs` had to
  assert hotkey behavior against the private handler.
- **`request_quit` — programmatic `app_loop` exit (#564).** Any callback (a
  File→Exit menu item, a button, a hotkey) can end the loop cleanly via the
  shared `_ui.quit_requested` flag, so the `gfx_close` teardown after the loop
  still runs; the previous escape was `exit of N`, which skipped it.
  `app_loop` clears the flag on entry, so a stale request never quits a later
  loop.

### Fixed
- **`label` carries `w`/`h`, and `label.auto_size` (#561).** It was the only
  text widget without them, and `_layout_toolbar`/`_layout_box` read
  `child.w`/`child.h` unconditionally — so the most natural toolbar child (a
  caption, a BPM or time display) crashed the layout engine with `cannot
  apply '-' to num and null`. The box is measured from the text at
  construction and, with `auto_size` at its default of 1, refreshed on every
  `_layout` pass — a label's text changes at runtime, and a size fixed at
  construction goes stale the first time it does. A label draws no chrome,
  so its box is exactly its text; spacing comes from the container's `gap`.

  Set `auto_size` to 0 to own the box yourself. Refreshing unconditionally
  would silently overwrite a size the app stamped — a fixed-width slot for
  changing text, a padded caption, or a label used as a plain sized rect
  (an invisible full-window click-catcher backing an overlay, since
  containers are hit-transparent where no child sits). Caught by running
  DeslanStudio's suite against this branch: its modal catcher is an *empty*
  label stamped to the window, and remeasuring collapsed it to `w=0`, so
  the dialog silently stopped being modal. The constructor measures once
  regardless, so a `null` size can never reach the layout engine.
- **A held piano key releases wherever the pointer ends up (#570).** The
  note-off lived in a `piano_kb` special case in `dispatch`'s mouseup that
  only ran when the mouseup hit-tested back to the same widget — so
  pressing a key and dragging off it, or releasing over a button, left the
  note sounding forever (the button branch returned before the release walk
  ever ran). `piano_kb` now registers a `clear_pressed` entry and `dispatch`
  runs the registry release walk on every mouseup, which also retires the
  special case. Found while verifying #570's original report, whose other
  two claims no longer reproduced.
- **`checkbox` and `toggle` show hover feedback (#594).** Both received
  `hover` from dispatch and their renderers ignored it. They now draw the
  same translucent `hover_shade`/`pressed_shade` overlay `button` uses,
  factored into a shared `_draw_hover_shade` — an overlay rather than a
  color swap, so it composes with a per-widget `bg` (#566) instead of
  erasing it.
- **combobox dropdown items are selectable by mouse (#577).** `dispatch`'s
  mousedown path ran `_close_dropdowns` *before* `_hit_test`, so an open
  dropdown's extended bounds were gone by the time the click was tested and
  the click landed on whatever sat underneath — `selected` never changed. The
  hit test now runs first and only the dropdowns the click falls outside of
  close (`_close_dropdowns_except`). Two further defects sat behind that one:
  `_mousedown_combobox` selected by `hover_index` (set only by a preceding
  mousemove, which plain `dispatch` need not send) rather than by the click's
  own y — it now shares `_combobox_item_at` with the hover path; and with the
  bounds extended, the click that opens a dropdown and the click that picks an
  item report the SAME widget id, so inside the 400 ms window the selection
  was swallowed as a double-click — an open dropdown is now exempt.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Live audio-streaming primitive — `audio_stream_open` / `audio_stream_push`
  / `audio_stream_queued` / `audio_stream_clear` / `audio_stream_close`
  (#612).** A dedicated SDL playback device in queue mode (callback-NULL), fed
  block-by-block via `SDL_QueueAudio`, coexisting with the callback mixer
  (`audio_open`) and the SDL_mixer music device (the OS mixes all three). This
  is what a synth needs that the fixed-buffer mixer channels cannot give:
  audio generated on the fly as notes start and stop, with no pre-rendered
  clip — the sustain path behind DeslanStudio musical typing (F-DS-17).
  `push` is a pure output sink (float→int16 with the `audio_play` size-cap /
  clamp / NaN guards; SDL copies the block, temp freed immediately; not
  trace-recorded). `audio_stream_queued` reads a live, timing-dependent value
  that steers the caller's refill control flow, so it carries the
  `TRACE_NONDET_TAKE`/`RECORD` tape pair exactly like `audio_capture_read`:
  under `EIGS_REPLAY` the recorded queue depth replays and the pump makes the
  same push decisions, keeping sessions byte-deterministic. Registered via the
  `ext_names.h` X-macro (zero lint/registrar drift); documented in
  `docs/BUILTINS.md`.
- **`buf_resample_linear` — C kernel for the endpoint-inclusive linear
  resample (#603).** The third leg of the DAW audio-I/O train:
  DeslanStudio's import spent 3.9 s resampling a 50 s stereo file on
  the N3350 in `ab_resample_linear`'s interpreted per-sample loop.
  `buf_resample_linear of [src, dst_len]` returns a NEW buffer with
  exactly that mapping — `pos = i*(n-1)/(dst_len-1)`, lerp between the
  floor/ceil neighbors, `num_guard` per step in VM evaluation order —
  bit-identical to the interpreted loop (differential-pinned across
  upsample/downsample/identity/single-sample shapes). The kernel is
  LINEAR interpolation, not Fourier/sinc (the consumer-documented
  divergence from `scipy.signal.resample`). `dst_len` 0 -> empty
  buffer; empty src with `dst_len > 0` raises `value`; allocation
  charged to the #292 sandbox budget; sandbox pure-compute allowlist;
  freestanding-safe.
- **Bulk PCM16LE codec builtins — `buf_from_pcm16le`, `buf_to_pcm16le`,
  `buf_deinterleave` (#602).** DeslanStudio's WAV import measured 10.8 s
  for a 50 s stereo 48 kHz file on the N3350 because the PCM16 byte
  decode (two `buf_get`s + two's-complement fold + `/ 32767` per sample,
  ~4.8 M times) was an interpreted loop; the write path is the same
  shape in reverse. These are the byte-codec siblings of the #597
  window kernels: decode a little-endian s16 window into a NEW float
  buffer, encode a float window into a NEW byte buffer (clamp,
  `round(x*32767)`, two's complement), and split interleaved frames
  into a channel buffer. Arithmetic mirrors the consumer's interpreted
  wavio loops step-for-step (`num_guard` per VM operation, same
  evaluation order) so each builtin is **bit-identical to the loop it
  replaces** — pinned by a differential suite leg (decode+deinterleave
  vs the fused wav_read loop, encode vs the wav_write loop, round-trip
  parity, deinterleave vs the stride loop) on seeded pseudo-random
  data. Loud bounds per the #597 family (`value`/`index_range`/
  `type_mismatch`, count 0 a valid no-op); output sizes charged to the
  #292 sandbox allocation budget; all three join the sandbox
  pure-compute allowlist; freestanding-safe.

### Changed
- **`waveform_view` selection now draws edge markers and clamps the
  fill to the widget.** The selection fill is a deliberately faint
  alpha-30 tint, so a selection spanning the whole visible range was a
  uniform wash with no boundary — imperceptible (DeslanStudio's
  Select All read as a dead button in driven QA; the model selected,
  the pixels said nothing). Each selection edge now draws a
  full-strength vertical line in the widget color, CLAMPED to the
  widget edge when the selection reaches past it (select-all lands at
  exactly `s1 == w`, which a visible-span-only test would skip), and
  the fill rect is clamped to the widget bounds instead of trusting
  `sel/zoom` arithmetic to stay on-screen.
- **`read_bytes_buf` over-cap reads now RAISE; `[path, max_bytes]` opt-in
  cap override (#601).** A file over the cap used to return null —
  indistinguishable from "file missing" — so a >10 MB asset died far
  downstream with a misleading diagnosis (DeslanStudio: a 3-minute WAV
  reported *"not a WAV file"*). The #490–#512 direction: over-cap now
  raises a catchable `io` error naming the actual size and the active
  cap. The raise survives replay — the observed size rides the tape as a
  `VAL_NUM` `N` record and the identical error is re-derived under
  `EIGS_REPLAY` with no live fs access. New bounded opt-in
  `read_bytes_buf of [path, max_bytes]` raises the ceiling for real
  assets (hard ceiling 512 MB: a buffer stores one double per byte, an
  8x fs→RAM amplification, so the ceiling bounds the worst case);
  bad `max_bytes` raises `value`. The 1-arg form keeps the 10 MB
  default — existing security posture unchanged — and the fail-closed
  sandbox allowlist still blocks `read_bytes_buf` entirely (posture
  pinned in test_sandbox_allow.eigs). Missing/unopenable files still
  return null.

### Added
- **Vectorized buffer kernels — `buf_mix`, `buf_scale_range`, `buf_fill`,
  `buf_peak`, `buf_dot` (#597).** DeslanStudio's render mix-down measured
  9.6 s for a 5 s arrangement on the N3350 because the mix kernel
  (`dst[i] += src[j] * gain`) was an interpreted per-sample loop, while
  stem rendering took 0.16 s riding the C-backed `buf_copy` — the first
  native-performance demand from a product consumer. These are C bulk
  ops over explicit `[off, count)` windows of numeric buffers: in-place
  mix (`buf_mix`), range multiply (`buf_scale_range`), range store
  (`buf_fill`), max-|x| scan (`buf_peak`), and windowed dot product
  (`buf_dot`, the YIN-autocorrelation kernel, under `dot`'s
  unspecified-association contract). Arithmetic mirrors the VM
  (`num_guard` per step) so each builtin is **exactly equal to the
  equivalent interpreted loop** — pinned by a differential suite leg on
  seeded pseudo-random buffers. Bounds are loud: negative count /
  out-of-range windows raise (`value`/`index_range`) with
  overflow-immune subtraction-form checks; count 0 is a no-op.
  `buf_copy`'s silent-null bad-bounds path upgraded to raise the same
  way (the #490–#512 direction). All five join the sandbox pure-compute
  allowlist (argument-only, no allocation, tape-neutral).
  `tests/bench_buf_mix.eigs` (220,500 stereo samples, n=5 medians,
  N3350): interpreted mix pass 104 ms (JIT) / 198 ms (interpreter) vs
  `buf_mix` 2.23 ms — **~47x / ~89x**; a 5 s mix-down's kernel cost
  drops from seconds to milliseconds.
- **lib/ui: per-widget button colors + hover/pressed shades (#566,
  first slice of #594).** `_render_button` honors optional `bg` /
  `text_color` fields on the button dict with theme fallback (the
  toggle_button/label pattern), so semantic coloring — the record-red /
  play-green transport buttons DeslanStudio had to drop (F-DS-12) — now
  works. Custom-colored buttons get hover/pressed feedback as new theme
  `hover_shade` / `pressed_shade` alpha overlays (a theme-color swap
  would erase the custom color); theme-colored buttons keep the exact
  `btn_hover`/`btn_pressed` swap, so existing apps render unchanged.
  Custom theme dicts without the new keys degrade gracefully (no
  shade). Docs: `gfx_rrect` and `gfx_clip` were registered but missing
  from BUILTINS.md (the #393 undiscoverability class) — rows added.
- **gfx: proportional antialiased text via SDL2_ttf (#593).** The
  DeslanStudio side-by-side against its Qt prototype showed feature
  parity reading a decade old, and the dominant gap was the 5x7 bitmap
  monospace font. `gfx_text` now lazily dlopens `libSDL2_ttf-2.0.so.0`
  (mirroring the SDL2/SDL2_mixer pattern — no headers, no hard
  dependency) and renders `TTF_RenderUTF8_Blended` through the texture
  path when a font is available; `EIGS_GFX_FONT` overrides discovery,
  else DejaVu/Liberation/Noto Sans are probed. `TTF_Font*` cached per
  size; signature unchanged (`scale` maps to a comparable pixel size).
  **The fallback is load-bearing**: without the library or a font the
  bitmap path is byte-identical to before (CI containers may have
  neither), and a bogus `EIGS_GFX_FONT` is the deterministic off-switch
  (pinned by suite section [120]). New metrics builtins
  `gfx_text_width of [text, scale?]` / `gfx_text_height of scale?`
  return real pixel metrics under the active renderer (bitmap math in
  fallback); `lib/ui` measurement (`text_width`/`text_height`/
  `_draw_text_clipped`) routes through them when present — probed once
  with the catch-undefined pattern so headless stubs keep working — so
  buttons, labels, menus, tabs, and dialogs center and clip
  proportional text correctly. Output-only: no trace-tape records in
  either mode.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **gfx audio capture: `audio_capture_open` / `audio_capture_read` /
  `audio_capture_close` (#579).** The gfx extension's audio surface was
  output-only; a DAW transport (DeslanStudio F-DS-17) could never
  record a real microphone. Pull-model recording via the already
  dlopen'd SDL2: `SDL_OpenAudioDevice(iscapture=1)` in queue mode +
  `SDL_DequeueAudio` — no callback, no C→eigs re-entry, fits the
  existing polling clients. `audio_capture_read` drains new samples as
  a **buffer** (the #578 fast type) of floats in `[-1, 1]`, capped at
  2048 samples per call so each trace record stays under the 64 KiB
  budget (i.e. replayable); loop until empty to drain fully. Tape-first:
  open and read are TAKE/RECORD builtins — under `EIGS_REPLAY` no real
  device is opened or read, the recorded id and sample buffers are
  served off the tape (docs/TRACE.md). `SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy` provides
  a silent capture device, so the gfx-suite tests run without hardware;
  graceful `0`/`null` without SDL or a device.

### Fixed
- **gfx audio: `audio_play` / `audio_play_loop` accept `VAL_BUFFER`
  samples (#578).** `audio_convert_samples` was list-only, so handing a
  buffer — the type the language recommends for bulk samples and what a
  DAW render produces — silently returned channel `0`; consumers had to
  convert buffer→list per play (a 3-minute stereo render is ~16M
  appends + VAL_NUM allocations) just for the C side to re-walk it into
  int16. Buffers now convert directly off their C double array (same
  clamping and 64 MB cap as lists); empty buffers are rejected like
  empty lists. Gfx-suite checks cover play, play_loop, clamping, the
  queued length, and the empty-buffer rejection.

### Added
- **`read_line` builtin (#558)** — blocking line read from stdin
  (`getline(3)`): returns the next line without its trailing newline
  (`\r\n` stripped as one unit), `null` at EOF, `""` for an empty line.
  The stream-safe stdin primitive: `read_text of "/dev/stdin"` sizes
  with fseek/ftell and silently reads `""` on a pipe, so a CLI in a
  shell pipeline (`gen | eigenscript client.eigs`) had no way to
  receive lines. Tape-first: recorded/replayed like `read_bytes`
  (TAKE/RECORD — replay serves recorded lines, no live stdin read).
  Hosted-only (freestanding profile excludes it, like the other IO).
- **`is_dir` builtin (#576)** — `is_dir of path` → 1/0 via `stat(2)`,
  replacing the consumer-side `file_exists of f"{path}/."` probe.
  Trace-recorded (`TRACE_NONDET_RET`), unlike the older untraced fs
  predicates (`file_exists`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `getcwd` — flagged as a
  follow-up).

### Fixed
- **`json_decode` accepts RFC 8259 exponent notation (#557).** The
  number scanner accepted `e`/`E`/`+` but never the `-` of a negative
  exponent, so `1e-06` — emitted by Python `json.dumps`, JS
  `JSON.stringify`, serde, and by EigenScript's own `json_encode`
  (`%.15g`) for tiny/huge magnitudes — failed to parse: encode→decode
  did not round-trip. The scanner now implements the exact RFC §6
  grammar (`[minus] int [frac] [exp]`) and raises on malformed tails
  (`"1e"`, `"1e+"`, `"1."`) instead of letting `atof()` guess silently.
  Leading zeros stay accepted (old laxity, unchanged).

### Added
- **Lint W019 — statement-level interrogative discards its result
  (#583).** `why is "..."` where `why` is a question word parses as the
  interrogative *expression* form, not an assignment — as a bare
  statement it is a silent no-op (the Tidepool hit: a catch handler
  "reassigning" a `local why` silently kept the stale value). Every
  statement-level interrogative (question words and `prev of`) is dead
  code and now warns; interrogatives inside expressions
  (`print of (why is x)`) are untouched. docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md documents
  the code.

### Fixed
- **Lint W013 attributed to the shadowing `define` line (#556).** The
  parser stamped `AST_FUNC` nodes with the line of the first statement
  *after* the body, so W013 pointed at innocent code, the documented
  same-line `# lint: allow W013` never matched, and consecutive
  shadowing defines chain-suppressed each other (N shadows → only the
  last warned). The node now carries the `define` token's line;
  same-line pragmas work and each shadow warns on its own line.
- **LSP no longer advertises a phantom `input` builtin (#559).**
  `eigenlsp` completion offered `input of prompt`, which was never
  registered in the runtime — accepting the completion produced
  `undefined variable: input`. Entry removed (#558 tracks a real
  stdin-read builtin).
- **`load_file` is silent by default (#560).** Every successful load
  printed an unconditional `[load_file] Loading ...` banner to stderr —
  a consumer CLI loading 17 fragments opened with 17 lines of runtime
  chatter no flag could turn off. No successful builtin announces
  itself; the banner is now opt-in via `EIGS_VERBOSE_LOAD=1`.

### Added
- **lib/ui input-event trio (#567, #568, #569)** — first-consumer
  findings from the DeslanStudio arrangement timeline:
  - **#568 — mouse events carry modifier state.** `gfx_poll` now
    attaches `shift`/`ctrl`/`alt` (0/1) to `mousemove`, `mousedown`,
    `mouseup`, and `wheel` events (via `SDL_GetModState`), mirroring
    what key events already exposed. Additive dict fields — headless
    tests that synthesize event dicts are unaffected (absent keys read
    null).
  - **#567 — canvas drag/mousemove seam.** `dispatch`'s drag-in-progress
    path is now registry-driven: each built-in draggable type (slider,
    vslider, knob, scrollbar, waveform_view, splitter, color_picker)
    registers an `on_drag(w, ev)` handler, and a custom widget that
    claimed the pointer (new `claim_drag of w` / `release_drag of null`
    API) receives every drag mousemove *and the terminating mouseup*
    through its `on_mouse(w, ev)` callback — press-move-release gestures
    now complete on a canvas. Hover mousemoves are also delivered to
    `on_mouse` (branch on `ev.type`). The sharp edge is gone: a claimant
    outside the old hardcoded type list no longer falls into the slider
    updater's `type_mismatch`; a claimant with no handler is a silent
    no-op.
  - **#569 — wheel seam.** A widget under the cursor exposing
    `on_wheel(w, ev)` consumes wheel input before the `scroll_panel`
    walk (`ev.x`/`ev.y` are the scroll deltas; modifiers ride along for
    ctrl+wheel zoom). Also fixed: `_layout` now subtracts a
    `scroll_panel`'s scroll offset when caching children's `_ax`/`_ay`,
    matching render and hit-test, so a canvas inside a scrolled panel
    keeps correct mouse math.
  - `examples/ui_canvas_events.eigs` (timeline-style canvas: clip
    drag-move, rubber-band select, ctrl+click toggle, wheel pan,
    ctrl+wheel zoom-at-cursor) exercises all three seams; UI suite [63]
    extended 81 → 115 checks.

### Fixed
- **Entropy walk: cycle + shared-structure detection (#571).** The
  observer's container entropy walk (`compute_entropy`) had only a
  depth-64 cap, so back-references multiplied re-walks: one
  back-referencing dict was linear (32 re-entries), a second made every
  observed container assignment ~2^32 subtree walks (0.07 ms → seconds
  to minutes — found by the DeslanStudio 4d port, whose second
  shell-back-referencing UI view hung `shell_new` for >10 minutes).
  The walk now carries a stack-local visited set (open-addressing
  pointer table, 16 inline slots, heap spill only for larger graphs;
  containers only — scalars pay nothing, and per-computation stack
  state can't race when spawn-shared graphs are observed on two
  threads at once). **Semantics**: each container node contributes its
  entropy once per computation; a re-encountered container reads as a
  0-entropy leaf. Trees and scalars are byte-identical to before;
  DAG-shaped data is no longer double-counted; cyclic graphs are now
  well-defined (previously depth-truncation-dependent). Suite section
  gated by `test_entropy_cycles.eigs` (8 checks);
  SPEC/OBSERVER/COMPARISON updated.

### Added
- **Borrow-scan guard in sanitizer builds (#548).** The #546 cap on
  `vm_borrow_scan` rests on the invariant *"no builtin returns a
  borrowed direct child past index 7"*, which was enforced only by a
  comment. In ASan builds the scan now continues past
  `VM_BORROW_SCAN_CAP` and `abort()`s naming the offending builtin
  (env-chain reverse lookup) on a match the capped scan missed —
  converting a future missed compensating incref from a
  lifetime-dependent use-after-free heisenbug into an immediate red
  test run. Zero release-build cost (compiler-set ASan macro gate).
  Validated by a planted fault: `__borrow_guard_selftest` (registered
  only in sanitizer builds under `EIGS_BORROW_GUARD_SELFTEST`, so
  fuzzers can't reach a deliberate abort) violates the invariant on
  purpose; suite [119] proves the abort fires, names the builtin, and
  that within-cap borrows stay clean. SKIPs on release.

### Fixed
- **Dot access accepts keyword-named fields (#542).** `d.loop`, `d.in`,
  `d.when` — any word keyword now parses as a dot key (read, write,
  compound assign, any chain depth, all three parser postfix sites).
  The position after `.` admits nothing but a field name, so the old
  `TOK_IDENT`-only check rejected programs with no ambiguity to protect
  against, leaving keys creatable by literal, `dict_set`, and
  `json_decode` reachable only by bracket — and contradicted SYNTAX.md's
  soft-keyword promise for `d.prev`/`d.at`. Found porting a DAW whose
  data model has `clip.loop` / event `when` fields. Suite [118]
  (49 checks); SPEC/SYNTAX/GRAMMAR/COMPARISON updated. The ouroboros
  `frontend.eigs` mirror lands with the next `EIGS_REF` bump
  (deferred-mirror pattern, #326/#328).

### Added
- **`--bundle`: single-file distribution (#413).** `eigenscript
  --bundle app.eigs out [--with-tape tape]` copies the runtime binary
  and appends an archive — the script, the adjacent `eigs_modules/`
  tree, the stdlib `lib/` modules, and optionally a trace tape — into
  one executable that runs on a machine with no EigenScript checkout.
  Startup detects the trailer magic on the binary's own tail, extracts
  to a tempdir (removed at exit), and rewrites argv to run the
  extracted script, so every existing resolution rule just works with
  no VFS or resolver changes. With a tape attached, `out --replay` is
  an **executable bug report**: it replays byte-identically, serving
  every nondet input from the tape — and the #411 version contract is
  pinned by construction, since the bundle carries the exact binary
  that recorded the tape. In bundle mode all arguments belong to the
  script (only `--replay` is intercepted); torn archives refuse with
  exit 3; re-bundling from a bundle copies only the runtime image.
  `tests/test_bundle.sh` (suite [42g], 8 checks) covers script+modules+
  stdlib from a bare cwd, arg passthrough, byte-identical replay of the
  recorded nondet, no-tape/torn refusals, and re-bundle size stability.
  docs/BUNDLE.md documents the format and the AOT (ouroboros) tier as
  the native-speed variant of the same single-file story.

### Fixed
- **Builtin calls with a single list argument were O(len(list)) (#546).**
  The direct-borrow heuristic that runs after every builtin call scanned
  the entire argument list comparing item pointers against the result.
  For multi-arg calls that list is the small VM-packed temp, but for a
  single list argument it was the caller's own list — so `len of xs`
  cost O(len(xs)) and the idiomatic `loop while i < (len of xs):` was
  quadratic (~520x slower than a hoisted length at 88k elements;
  surfaced by DeslanStudios audio-buffer rendering). The scan is now
  factored into `vm_borrow_scan` (shared by CASE(CALL),
  jit_helper_call, and OP_DISPATCH) and capped at the maximum builtin
  arity: a borrowing builtin can only return a child it actually read,
  and every builtin reads its argument vector at small fixed indices,
  so items past the cap can never be the borrowed result. The borrow
  contract (coalesce/dict_set returning a child of a raw list variable,
  a dying-temporary argument, >cap-length raw lists) is pinned in
  tests/test_call_semantics.eigs. 88k-iteration len-in-condition loop:
  5,033ms -> 17.5ms.

### Added
- **Tape format v2: scope-qualified locals (#539 v2).** A new `S <fn>
  <depth> <serial>` scope-transition record qualifies the `A` records
  that follow, so a function-local binding and a same-named top-level
  one are separate streams — and two invocations of the same function
  never merge (`<serial>` is a per-thread frame-instance id stamped at
  every frame push, `CallFrame.call_serial`). Emitted with the L-record
  dedup discipline: byte cost lands only at call boundaries that
  actually assign (worst-case call-heavy fixture: +43% tape bytes, ~8%
  traced runtime; zero S records in straight-line module code, zero
  cost untraced). `TRACE_FORMAT_VERSION` 1→2 — v1 tapes refuse per the
  #411 version-and-reject rule; replay skips `S` like `A` (byte-exact
  replay determinism unchanged). `--step` reconstructs the call chain
  from the serials: `p` shows the live chain's bindings innermost-first
  with `{in fn}` notes and shadowing (dead frames' locals no longer
  appear), and `t name` resolves to the frame's own stream, so
  trajectory labels are per-invocation. `tests/test_step.sh` grows six
  scope checks; docs/TRACE.md documents the record and the v2 history.
- **Runtime-error carets + token-precise LSP ranges (#407 residual).**
  Uncaught runtime errors now print the same one-line source excerpt +
  `^` caret as parse errors, with the column attributed to the failing
  token (the `[` of an out-of-range subscript, the operator of a type
  mismatch, the undefined identifier, the `of` of a bad call). Mechanism:
  a per-byte `cols[]` table beside the chunk's `lines[]` (stamped by
  `compile_node`'s save/set/restore position cursor — zero dispatch-loop
  cost, no OP_LINE/tape change), a refcounted per-unit source blob shared
  by nested function chunks (so REPL lines, eval'd strings, and imported
  modules all excerpt their own source), and uncaught-error printing
  deferred from raise time to the dispatch loop's `CHECK_ERROR`, which
  knows the failing instruction's offset. A `lines[off] == error_line`
  guard suppresses the caret whenever the position can't be attributed
  confidently (e.g. JIT-advanced ip), so a caret never points at the
  wrong line. The `Error line N:` message and `  at fn (line N)` trace
  lines are byte-unchanged. LSP diagnostics are now token-precise:
  E002 (parse) and E003 (undefined name) squiggle exactly the offending
  token instead of the whole line (0..1000 span remains only as the
  no-position fallback). `examples/errors/*` pin runtime carets via a
  new `# expect-caret:` directive; `tests/test_lsp.py` pins the ranges.
- **The observer pair: value-channel raw-step signals (#422) + trajectory
  snapshots across call boundaries (#421).**
  - *#422*: relative normalization (`Δv/(1+|v|)`) erased exactly two
    trajectory classes, and both misread as *accepting* regimes: an
    additive/polynomial runaway (`x → x + c` seeded large) read
    `converged`/`stable`, and a perpetual oscillation below the deadband
    (`x → -x` seeded at 4e-4, or a fixed absolute swing around a large
    offset) read `stable`/`converged`. The `ObserverSlot` value channel now
    keeps a parallel window of RAW steps and asks one structural question —
    are the steps **non-vanishing** (recent-half mean ≥ half the older-half
    mean, above a `4·ε·(1+|v|)` fp-noise floor)? Non-vanishing same-sign
    steps classify `diverging` (the value channel's first use of the label;
    geometric runaway upgrades from `moving` too); non-vanishing alternating
    steps classify `oscillating`. Damped (decaying-step) trajectories still
    settle to `converged`. `lib/contract.eigs`: `expect_converging` now
    fails FAST on a mid-run `diverging`; `invariant_stable` throws on it;
    the documented #422 blind-spot caveats are gone.
  - *#421*: observer state is binding-identity, so a value passed into a
    function arrived with no history — a contract could not classify what
    its caller built. New special form `trajectory of x` snapshots the
    binding's observer windows into a plain transparent dict
    (`kind`/`rel`/`raw`/`dh`/`entropy`/…), and new builtin `classify of t`
    (or `classify of [t, "entropy"]`) classifies it with the SAME
    slot machinery `report_value`/`report` use (opcodes
    OP_TRAJECTORY_SLOT/NAME, appended per the ABI rule). `classify` of a
    non-snapshot raises `type_mismatch` — a bare value never silently
    classifies as "no trajectory". `lib/contract.eigs` gains the snapshot
    form `expect_regime of [trajectory of x, expected, msg]` alongside the
    step-fn contracts; the lint knows `trajectory` as a special form (E003).
  - Suite section [50j2] (`tests/test_trajectory.eigs`, 20 checks) pins both
    issue repros red→green, the damped/settled/halving no-regressions, the
    call-boundary crossing, both channels, the loud error paths, and
    `expect_regime`. SPEC.md/COMPARISON.md gain byte-pinned examples;
    OBSERVER.md documents the raw-step signal and the snapshot model.
- **`--step` — the eigsdap v1 CLI tape-stepper (#418).**
  `eigenscript --step <tape> [source.eigs]` opens a recorded trace tape
  (from `--trace`, `EIGS_TRACE`, or a `--test --trace-on-fail` failure) in
  an interactive time-travel debugger: step forward AND backward over line
  events, breakpoints as line filters with `c`/`rc` continue in both
  directions, jump-to-line both ways, and binding reconstruction from the
  tape's assignment deltas at any position. `p` shows each binding's value
  *plus its observer-trajectory label* — computed by the runtime's own
  #294 value-channel classifier (`observer_slot_record_value` is now
  exported so the stepper feeds reconstructed histories through the same
  `ObserverSlot` the language uses; a mirror implementation could drift,
  this cannot) — and `t <name>` shows the running label per assignment, so
  stepping back rewinds the *diagnosis*: walk `rc` backward to the exact
  step where a binding flipped from `[moving]` to `[oscillating]`. Pure
  tape reader (nothing executes, step-back is an index decrement); #411
  version rule enforced exactly like replay (mismatch = refuse, exit 3);
  CLI-only translation unit (`src/step.c`), excluded from the embed/LSP/
  freestanding profiles. New suite section [42f] (16 checks,
  `tests/test_step.sh`) covers stepping, label flips on back-step,
  breakpoints, jumps, refusals, and driving a `--trace-on-fail` tape.
  Ships with docs/DEBUGGING.md — the failure→replay→interrogate loop,
  the stepper, and the temporal interrogatives in one place.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- **`task_detach` — fire-and-forget tasks reap their handle slot (#530).**
  Finished tasks were never removed from the 255-slot handle table before
  process exit, so `task_spawn` failed after 255 spawns per process — a
  LIFETIME cap, even when every task was joined. `task_detach of id`
  (pthread-detach precedent) marks a task nobody will join: it is reaped the
  moment it finishes (or immediately if already finished, or when
  `task_kill`ed), returning its slot to the pool — the cap now bounds
  *concurrent* tasks, as its message always claimed. A detached task's
  uncaught death still prints and still fails the process (#493 — the flag
  survives the reap in a scheduler-level counter). A task may detach itself
  via `task_self`. Also fixes ready-queue poisoning found by the same
  workload: a task killed while READY left a stale queue entry, and enough
  of them filled the fixed 256-slot queue, whose push then SILENTLY dropped
  real wakeups — a spurious "deadlock". `task_kill` now removes the victim's
  pending entry. Surfaced by the #523 liferaft migration (a deliverer task
  per in-flight message; crash-teardown kills pending deliverers in bulk).
- **`task_self` — a task can learn its own id (#526).** `task_self of null`
  returns the running task's id in the same integer space `task_spawn`
  returns (the main task is 0, including before any task has been spawned).
  Surfaced by `lib/supervise` (#409): without it a worker has no reply
  address to hand out, so message-link supervision — a worker delivering its
  exit as an ordinary message to its supervisor's mailbox — was not
  expressible. Deterministic (pure scheduler state, zero tape records).
- **`lib/supervise` — observer-native supervision (#409).** A supervisor over
  the #408 cooperative task layer that, beyond BEAM-style crash-restart, also
  catches the silently **wedged** worker — alive, not crashed, never timing
  out, but no longer making progress — a signal BEAM structurally cannot see.
  Workers publish raw progress with `heartbeat of [slot, value]`; the
  supervisor samples each alive worker every tick, feeds a **bounded** signature
  (`1.5 + v % 8`, dodging the #294 flat-entropy blind spot) into that slot's
  observer trajectory, and restarts a worker whose signature has gone `stable`
  after a warm-up window (the EigenOS red-title pattern, generalized) or that
  died with an uncaught raise — each up to a per-worker restart-intensity cap.
  `supervisor_new`, `supervise of [sup, fn, slot]`, `supervise_step`, and
  `supervise_run of [sup, max_ticks]`. Deterministic by construction; flagship
  `examples/supervisor_tree.eigs`. Surfaced a gap: a task cannot learn its own
  id (no `task_self`), so the message-link supervision variant is not yet
  expressible — filed separately.
- **Lint `W018` — `e.kind` compared against an out-of-set error kind (#469).**
  A `catch` handler comparing a caught error's `.kind` against a string that is
  a near-miss of a real kind — a case variant (`"IO"`), a single-character typo
  (`"index_rage"`), or a kind renamed out from under the handler — is dead code
  that silently never fires. The new rule warns and suggests the intended kind.
  Zero-false-positive by construction: the closed kind set is derived from
  `err_kind_name` at run time (no hand list to drift — it already covers the
  post-#509 `deadlock`), and a warning requires all of (1) the `.kind` read off
  a **catch-bound** variable, (2) a non-exact match, and (3) a near-miss
  (case variant or edit distance 1) — so a valid kind and a genuinely custom
  `throw {kind: "..."}` value both stay silent. Calibrated to zero hits over
  `lib/`, the test corpus, and the consumer repos.
- **Per-file lint allow-list in `eigs.json` (#455).** A project can now silence
  a lint code for a whole file without editing it — an `eigs.json` `lint.allow`
  map from project-root-relative path to a list of codes (`"all"` silences
  every code): `{"lint":{"allow":{"lib/generated.eigs":["W003","W017"]}}}`. The
  escape for generated or vendored modules that shouldn't carry inline
  `# lint: allow` comments. Resolution walks from the linted file up to the
  project root (the dir containing `eigs.json`, reusing the module resolver's
  walk), so it applies regardless of the cwd. A code allowed here filters
  exactly like a `# lint: allow-file <code>`. Closes the last residual of #399.
  (`--lint`; the in-file directives still cover the LSP.)
- **`lib/sync` — cooperative-task locks (#488).** A `lib/sync.eigs` stdlib
  module giving mutual exclusion **across** `task_yield` points for the #408
  task layer: `lock_new` / `lock_acquire` / `lock_release`, plus
  `with_lock of [lock, fn]` (runs `fn of null` under the lock, releasing even
  if the body raises, then re-raising). `lock_acquire` cooperatively yields
  until the lock is free, then claims it — correct because there is no
  preemption between the acquire check passing and the claim. Surfaced by the
  `eddy` consumer (concurrency-control DST): a critical section that spans a
  yield needs an explicit lock, since only a non-yielding region is implicitly
  atomic.
- **`must_not_yield of fn` — assert a critical region is atomic (#488).** The
  other half of #488: a region relies on cooperative atomicity (mutual
  exclusion for free) *only* while it issues no yield, but nothing marked such
  a region, so a `task_yield` — or a builtin that yields internally — introduced
  later broke atomicity **silently** (a rare, seed-dependent anomaly).
  `must_not_yield of fn` runs `fn of null` as an atomic section: any suspending
  task builtin inside (`task_yield`, a blocking `task_recv`/`task_join`,
  `task_sleep`) raises `value` instead of suspending, so the mistake fails
  loudly. Non-suspending ops (`task_try_recv`, `task_send`, joining a finished
  task) are allowed. The region depth is balanced even when the body raises,
  and it nests. Surfaced by the `eddy` consumer's snapshot-isolation commit
  loop (atomic only because it contains no yield).

### Changed
- **`deadlock` is now catchable (#509).** A cooperative-task deadlock (all
  tasks blocked, none runnable) was raised inside the scheduler trampoline and
  surfaced as a fatal process error — a `try`/`catch` around `task_join` never
  ran. It is now delivered as an ordinary catchable error at the **main task's**
  blocked join/recv site: the handler binds `e.kind == "deadlock"` (message
  `all tasks are blocked — deadlock`) and execution continues after the block,
  matching how a killed task's `interrupt` is catchable. A deadlock with no
  handler on main stays terminal — loud message, non-zero exit — so uncaught
  behavior is unchanged; a handler inside a *worker* does not catch it (the
  error goes to main). Implementation note: the fatal print no longer routes
  through `rt_error`'s `g_try_depth` gate, since a suspended worker's still-open
  try can leave that global non-zero between task switches (it is not part of a
  task's saved slice) — the trampoline decides catchable-vs-terminal from main's
  saved frames directly.
- **Cooperative task layer — exit-code and arena-guard fixes (#493, #510).**
  Two silent-tolerance holes in the #408 task layer:
  - **#493:** a worker that dies of an uncaught error while nothing
    `task_join`s it now makes the **process exit non-zero** instead of
    silently returning 0 — a fire-and-forget worker's death can no longer
    green a run (`task_spawn` without a join hid failures). Joining and
    catching still recovers (exit 0); a deliberate `task_kill` is a teardown,
    not an uncaught error, and does not fail the process. Documented in
    docs/SPEC.md (task layer) and the docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md exit-code table.
  - **#510:** the arena guard on the suspending task builtins
    (`task_yield` / `task_recv` / `task_sleep`) is now checked **before** the
    no-scheduler short-circuit, so `arena_mark … task_yield … arena_reset`
    raises `value` even before any `task_spawn` — the "no-op with no tasks"
    rule no longer hides the documented "forbidden inside an arena" rule.

- **#483 — leak of the suspended main slice on a fatal exit.** When the process
  ends while task 0 (main) is still **suspended** — a `deadlock`, or main
  blocked on a join/recv that never resolves — `task_sched_thread_free` freed
  main's saved-slice arrays on the "main always ran to completion, slice is
  empty" assumption, which is false here. Main's base module frame owns a
  counted chunk ref (the script chunk) and its operand stack owns value refs;
  those leaked (the script chunk plus every nested fn chunk in its constant
  pool — ~10 KB on the deadlock repro). Now the slice is torn down ref-correctly
  (mirroring `task_free`'s worker-slice teardown) before the arrays are freed.
  Worker tasks were already clean (reaped by `handle_table_drain` → `task_free`);
  only main's slice was missed. Gated by a leak-checked deadlock regression test
  — which is also what surfaced this: the original repro read clean under a
  one-shot LSan run (a stale stack slot kept the block reachable — a false
  negative), and only the in-suite test made it reproduce reliably.
- **Silent-tolerance audit, batch 2 — invalid input raises instead of
  returning a silent wrong value** (#497, #498, #499, #501, #502, #511,
  #512). Builtins that used to fold bad input to a `null`/`0`/`""`/
  wrong-order sentinel — the hardest class of bug to spot in a data or
  numeric pipeline — now raise a catchable error from the closed error-kind
  set:
  - `matmul` — incompatible shapes raise `value`, non-matrix operands raise
    `type_mismatch`, an oversized result raises `limit` (#512).
  - `sha256` / `md5` / `sha256_file` / `md5_file` / `hmac_sha256` — a
    non-string argument raises `type_mismatch` (was the empty-string
    sentinel, i.e. a silent wrong digest); the `_file` variants also raise
    `io` when the file can't be opened (#511).
  - `range` — a non-numeric argument raises `type_mismatch` (#497); a
    request past the 1M cap raises `limit` instead of silently building an
    unbounded list (the cap used to size only the prealloc while the loop
    ran to the original bound — an OOM, #498).
  - `sort_by` — a key function returning a non-number raises `type_mismatch`
    (was coerced to `0.0`, a silent wrong order); mirrors `sort` (#368) (#501).
  - `get_at` / `set_at` and `buf_get` / `buf_set` — an out-of-range index
    raises `index_range` and a non-list/non-buffer target or non-integer
    index raises `type_mismatch`, matching the `xs[i]` operator (was a silent
    fold-to-0 / no-op) (#499, #502).

  Batch 2b — the remaining builtins in the same class (#500, #503, #504,
  #506, #507, #508):
  - `len` — a value with no length (number, fn, `null`, …) raises
    `type_mismatch` instead of folding to `0`. Callers meaning "empty if
    absent" already guard with `x != null and len of x`, and `and`
    short-circuits, so the guarded `len` is never reached (#508).
  - `append` — a non-list target (including the `append of xs` #405
    arg-vector footgun, where a 2-element `xs` arrives as `[target, item]`)
    raises `type_mismatch` instead of a silent no-op. Pass a literal list
    whole with the paren form: `append of ([ys, item])` (#506).
  - `regex_match` / `regex_find` / `regex_replace` — an invalid pattern
    raises `value` (was `[]` / the input unchanged — indistinguishable from
    a clean no-match) and a non-string operand raises `type_mismatch` (#500).
  - `substr` — a negative start counts from the end, matching `char_at` and
    the `[]` operator (was a flat clamp-to-0 — an inconsistency) (#504).
  - `list_truncate` — a negative length raises `value` instead of silently
    emptying the list (an undocumented soft clamp) (#503).
  - `json_path` — an empty path segment (a leading/trailing dot or `..`)
    raises `value` instead of being silently skipped by `strtok`, which
    masked a malformed path; a genuine lookup miss still returns `""` (#507).

  Batch 2c — `json_decode` strictness (#495):
  - `json_decode` rejects malformed input with a `value` error instead of
    silently succeeding. A truncated document (`[1, 2,`, `{"a":`), an
    unterminated string, a partial/garbage container (`{]`, `[1,2,3,]`),
    over-deep nesting, and trailing garbage after a complete value
    (`[1,2,3] trailing`, `42abc`) all used to return a partial value with
    `rc=0` — and a genuine JSON `null` was indistinguishable from a parse
    failure (both returned `null`). Valid JSON is unchanged. `json_path` and
    the HTTP header/body parsers keep their lenient behavior (they ignore the
    strict-parse flag) (#495).

  Batch 2d — channel/IO/parser silent successes (#505, #490, #494):
  - `send` to a **closed** channel raises a catchable `value` error instead
    of silently dropping the value with `rc=0`. A producer that races a
    consumer's `close_channel` used to lose messages with no signal; now it
    fails loud. `recv` on a closed empty channel still returns `null`
    (EOF-like — that half is intended) (#505).
  - `load_file` of a missing/unreadable path raises a catchable `io` error
    instead of printing to stderr and returning a silent `null` with `rc=0`.
    This matches `import`'s severity and the same function's own parse/compile
    failure paths; a typo'd path is no longer a soft no-op (#490).
  - **Parser: a missing expression is a parse error, not a silent `null`.**
    An expression required after `is` / `of` / a unary operator, or as a
    `throw` / `print` argument, that runs into the end of the line
    (`x is`, `print of`, `throw of`, `eval of "x is "`) used to bind/emit
    `null` and continue with `rc=0` — a truncated or generated program looked
    like a soft no-op. It now raises `Parse error line N: expected expression`
    (catchable `parse` from `eval`/`import`/`load_file`). Bare `return`
    (the one legitimate empty-expression position) still yields `null` (#494).

### Fixed
- **Same-instant sleeper wake order no longer depends on handle IDs (#535).**
  `sched_wake_sleepers` woke due sleepers in ascending handle-id order, but
  ids come from a rotating next-fit cursor — so once slots recycle (#530),
  the tie-break encoded the process's whole allocation history and two
  identical seeded runs in one process could interleave differently
  (surfaced by liferaft's in-sweep fault verify failing to reproduce
  standalone). Tasks now carry a monotonic `spawn_seq` and same-instant
  wakes order by it — a pure function of the run. Regression-pinned with a
  wraparound-straddling sleeper race (`tests/test_task_sleep_order.eigs`).
- **JIT: task code now stays interpreted at EVERY entry point (#533).** The
  #408 ruling ("task code runs interpreted") was enforced only at the
  fresh-entry gate: the OSR back-edge counter/handoff and the OP_CALL /
  OP_DISPATCH thunk entries weren't task-gated, so a task's hot loop was
  JIT-compiled MID-TASK after ~OSR-threshold iterations — and
  `jit_helper_call` has no suspend check, so a blocking `task_recv`'s
  placeholder null flowed onward as the received message and the leaked
  suspend flag suspended the task mid-expression at a later call site.
  Symptom: mass task death / `null` from `task_recv` / corrupted locals
  after ~5000 loop iterations (first seen as liferaft's node tasks dying en
  masse under chaos — reachable at all only once #530 lifted the lifetime
  spawn cap). All four entry points now check `g_task_sched`;
  regression-pinned with an OSR-threshold-crossing recv loop
  (`tests/test_task_osr.eigs`, red pre-fix / green post-fix).
- **`dict_remove` no longer inflates the dict's hash table exponentially.**
  The re-index rebuild after a removal reused the grow path's blind
  capacity-doubling, so N removes on one dict grew its table by 2^N —
  ~25 insert/remove cycles of a single key allocated gigabytes and OOMed
  the process. The rebuild now sizes the table from the live entry count
  (identical doubling behavior on the >70%-load grow path). Surfaced by
  liferaft's per-message pending-registry churn during the #523 task-layer
  migration; regression-pinned in `tests/test_dict.eigs` (200-cycle churn).
- **`args` now rides the trace tape (#471).** The `args` builtin returned
  `argv` directly, unwrapped — the last un-taped nondeterminism source
  reachable by a pure script, and a hole in the closed-world invariant behind
  deterministic replay. A program that branched on `args` recorded a tape
  under one invocation and silently diverged when replayed under a different
  argv (the exact class chaos-mode `--seed N` scheduling for the #408 task
  layer would hit). The recorded argument list now rides the tape as one `N`
  record and replay serves it regardless of the live argv. Because `args`
  *builds* its list before returning, it uses the `TRACE_NONDET_TAKE` /
  `TRACE_NONDET_RECORD` pair (not `TRACE_NONDET_RET`), so under replay the
  live list is neither built nor leaked. Regression: `tests/test_replay.sh`
  (record under `A B`, replay under `X Y Z`, recorded args win).
- **Circular `import` / `load_file` no longer crashes (#496).** A mutual or
  self-referential `import` (a→b→a) or `load_file` used to recurse through
  `vm_execute` until the C stack overflowed — SIGSEGV, `rc=139`, uncatchable.
  The module cache is only populated *after* a load completes, so the
  re-entrant load missed the cache and recursed. A per-`EigsState` in-flight
  load stack now records paths whose load is on the current C stack; the
  loader raises a catchable `io` error (`import: circular dependency — '…' is
  already being loaded`) instead of recursing. Shared by `import` and
  `load_file`, so a cycle that crosses the two is caught too. Repeated
  *sequential* loads of the same file stay legal — only active re-entrancy is
  a cycle. Regression: suite section **[115]**.
- **`for x in xs` snapshots the iteration length at loop entry (#491).**
  ITER_NEXT used to re-read the sequence's *live* length every step, so a
  body that appended to `xs` looped forever (unbounded memory, OOM) and one
  that removed from the front skipped elements. The length is now fixed at
  entry and bounded by `min(snapshot, live length)`: appending can't extend
  the loop, and removing stops at the live length instead of reading a freed
  slot. `for` over a sequence mutated in its body is now well-defined — it
  visits exactly the indices 0..N-1 that existed at entry, read live (SPEC
  updated). Applies to both the interpreter and JIT tiers and to list
  comprehensions. Regression: suite section **[117]**.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Cooperative task seeded scheduling — increment 4 (#408).**
  `task_sched_seed of n` switches the scheduler from FIFO round-robin to
  picking the next ready task from a seeded, platform-independent PRNG
  (splitmix64). The schedule stays **fully deterministic** — the same seed
  produces the same interleaving on every run and replays byte-identically
  with **zero tape `N` records** — but a *different* seed explores a
  *different* ordering. This is the pluggable strategy hook a deterministic
  simulation tester (liferaft) uses to search the interleaving space while
  keeping every run reproducible. Without a seed the scheduler is
  unchanged (the FIFO fast path is untouched), so existing programs behave
  exactly as before. Completes the #408 primitives; next is the liferaft
  differential-proof migration.
- **Cooperative task virtual time — increment 3 (#408).** `task_sleep of
  ticks` suspends a task on a **logical clock**; `task_now of null` reads
  it. The clock starts at 0 and only jumps *forward to the earliest
  sleeper* when nothing else is runnable (discrete-event simulation) —
  so a program that sleeps runs in zero real time and stays deterministic
  by construction: identical on two fresh processes, replays
  byte-identically, and records **zero tape `N` records** (the clock is
  not a nondeterministic source). Sleepers waiting on the clock are no
  longer mistaken for a `deadlock`; ties at the same wake time break by
  ascending task id. A negative sleep clamps to 0; `task_sleep of 0` is a
  same-tick yield; with no task ever spawned it is a no-op like
  `task_yield`. This is the election-timeout / heartbeat primitive the
  deterministic Raft simulator (liferaft) needs. Not yet: the pluggable
  seeded-strategy hook for the DST consumer.
- **Cooperative task mailboxes — increment 2 (#408).** `task_send` /
  `task_recv` / `task_try_recv` / `task_kill`: unbounded FIFO mailboxes
  (Erlang-style; bounded/backpressure is a later add) with messages
  deep-copied across the boundary (share-nothing, like channels).
  `task_recv` blocks cooperatively on an empty mailbox — reusing the
  increment-1 suspend/resume machinery, delivered on wake — while
  `task_try_recv` is the non-blocking form. Sending to a finished or
  unknown task is a **silent drop** returning 0 (Akka dead-letters /
  Erlang cast — an error path here would be a nondeterminism magnet),
  not an error. `task_kill` tears a task down deterministically and
  wakes any joiner with an `interrupt` error. Still deterministic by
  construction (byte-identical across runs). Not yet: virtual time
  (`task_sleep`) and the pluggable seeded-strategy hook for the DST
  consumer.
- **Deterministic cooperative tasks — increment 1 (#408).** `task_spawn`
  / `task_yield` / `task_join` / `task_alive`: a single-OS-thread
  cooperative scheduler whose interleaving is deterministic **by
  construction** — no trace records, byte-identical across runs. Tasks
  are reified VM contexts (a copying-stack save-buffer per suspended
  task, not a 1.28 MB VM each); the JIT and non-atomic refcount fast
  paths stay live because the scheduler never flips the multithreaded
  flag. Args and results cross the boundary deep-copied (share-nothing,
  like channels). `task_join` returns the worker's result or re-raises
  its uncaught error as the same `{kind, message, line}`. All-tasks-
  blocked is a new `deadlock` error kind (loud, not a hang); suspending
  inside an `arena_mark`…`arena_reset` scope or a nested evaluation is a
  `value` error. Not yet: mailboxes/`task_send` (increment 2), virtual
  time, the pluggable seeded-strategy hook for the DST consumer.
  Increment 1c hardening: adversarial valgrind/ASan planted-fault
  verification proved the arena guard and the save-buffer teardown are
  load-bearing, and surfaced+fixed a real bug — a task ending inside an
  active arena scope arena-allocated its error dict (which crosses to the
  joiner) and left the arena active for the next task; `sched_finish` now
  forces the arena inactive. Determinism is a suite gate (two-run
  byte-identical), and SPEC gains an executable Tasks section.
- **E003 is scope-precise (#404, increment two)** — the undefined-name
  pass models the runtime's real scope rules instead of a whole-file
  binding set: function-locals (fresh-name `is` and `local`) are
  invisible to siblings and module code, closures read enclosing
  function scopes, nested `define` names are enclosing-local, and a
  module-level `for` loop-scopes its variable (a post-loop read is a
  runtime error the lint now catches; function-level `for` vars
  survive, matching the VM). Messages gain an edit-distance-1
  suggestion: `undefined name 'totl' — no binding on any path (did you
  mean 'total'?)`. Calibration: zero E003 across lib/, examples/,
  tests/ and all 10 consumer repos. External files (`load_file`
  targets, `# lint: loaded-by` composers) still contribute a flat
  over-approximated set. Path-precise "unbound on THIS path" analysis
  remains #404's last increment.
- **Structured runtime errors (#406, BREAKING)** — `catch` now binds a
  `{kind, message, line}` dict for built-in runtime errors instead of
  the flat `"Error line N: ..."` string: `kind` from a closed,
  SPEC-enumerated vocabulary (`undefined_name`, `type_mismatch`,
  `value`, `index_range`, `parse`, `io`, `limit`, `sandbox`,
  `interrupt`, `assert`, `internal`), `message` without the line frame,
  `line` 1-based. Discriminating error classes no longer means string
  matching. User-thrown values bind untouched, as before; uncaught
  stderr output is unchanged. Also: builtin raise sites now stamp the
  live source line (previously `Error line 0:`), `assert` failures are
  ordinary catchable errors (kind `assert`; caught asserts no longer
  print to stderr), `sandbox_run`'s result carries `"error": {kind,
  message, line}` when `ok` is 0, and the embed API gains
  `eigs_last_error_kind()` / `eigs_last_error_line()`. The kind table
  lives in docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md; SPEC.md Error handling rewritten with
  executable examples (suite EM26–EM30).
- **Parse errors print a source excerpt with a caret under the offending
  column (#407, increment two)** — for the column-carrying errors
  (`expected X, got Y`, one-statement-per-line), in the script runner,
  `--lint`, and the REPL. Additive: the `Parse error line N:C: ...`
  message is byte-unchanged, so substring-matching tools keep working.
  Remaining #407 scope: per-warning spans, runtime-error columns.

### Changed
- **Observer surface coherence (#412), two settled decisions.** (1)
  **Unity is the horizon**: the `|x| == 1.0` entropy special case is
  gone — the binary-entropy formula is smooth and maximal there
  (`H = 1.0`), so a value placed exactly at `1.0` reads like its
  neighbors (a flat run at `1.0` classifies `equilibrium`, never
  `converged`); `|x| == 0` keeps `H = 0`, the formula's own home-point
  limit. (2) **`how` is a real 0–1 gradient**: deadband-normalized
  settledness of the last observed step, `1 - min(1, |dH|/dh_zero)` —
  `1.0` = entropy unmoved, `0.0` = moved by the settle deadband or
  more. Pure in the recorded `dH`, so `how is x at L` reads identically
  from tape history (no tape format change). The old
  `1 - entropy/last_entropy` was degenerate (always `0` or `1`).
  OBSERVER.md's "Rough edges" caveats are closed as settled decisions.

### Added
- **JIT loop back-edges poll the async abort flag (#410)** — hard
  timeouts (`eigs_set_abort_flag`) now hold at full speed. The gap was
  the from-zero thunk: a call-hot function's loop closes natively via the
  backward patch and never crossed an interpreted back-edge (the OSR tier
  always re-entered through the interpreted `JUMP_BACK`, so it already
  polled). The emitter now plants a movabs/deref/cmpl poll before every
  native back-edge that bails to the interpreter at the `JUMP_BACK` when
  set — the interpreter consumes the flag and raises the ordinary
  catchable "aborted" error; no error machinery in native code. The flag
  pointer is now never NULL (unregistered points at a static zero), so
  both tiers poll with a single deref. Bench medians unchanged within
  noise (n=5: dmg_shape 326.3→323.4 ms, idxset 39.6→38.8 ms). The
  EMBEDDING.md / eigs_embed.h "JIT'd loops don't poll" caveat is deleted.
- **`# lint: loaded-by <relpath>` fragment directive (#460)** — a library
  fragment declares its composer (the entry point that `load_file`s it, or
  a concat sibling in out-of-language composition); E003 collects the named
  file's transitive binding set as context and lints the fragment against
  it. Kills the ~380 cross-module false positives the v0.27.0 consumer
  sweep hit (DMG 217→0, EigenMiniSat 99→0, verified on the real repos)
  while — unlike `# lint: allow-file E003` — a genuine typo in the fragment
  still fires. Repeatable, works in `--lint` and the LSP (which now passes
  the live document buffer through `lint_collect`, so as-you-type edits to
  the directive take effect), fails open on an unresolvable context.
  Documented in docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md.

### Fixed
- **A user rebinding of `dispatch` wins over the `OP_DISPATCH`
  superinstruction (#459)** — previously `define dispatch(a, b, c)` (or a
  plain `dispatch is ...`, including a write-through assignment inside a
  function body) was silently ignored at `dispatch of [t, k, a]` call
  sites: the compiler keyed on the name alone and emitted the fast path
  regardless of the binding. The superinstruction now steps aside — for
  any unit that binds `dispatch` anywhere or references `eval` (dynamic
  escape), and for a REPL/embed unit compiled against an env where the
  name is already rebound — failing open to the semantically identical
  normal call path. The parenthesized `dispatch of ([t, k, a])` form now
  also takes the normal path (one argument, per the #355/#405 contract).
- **W012/W013 (builtin shadowing) derive from `register_builtins()`
  itself, not a hand list (#459)** — the old hand-copied array was ~120
  names behind the binary, so shadowing `dispatch`, `chr`, `eval`, and
  every other post-list builtin lint'd clean. Same derivation as E003's
  binding base, plus the extension names (`ext_names.h`).

### Changed
- **Decided (#459): `report`, `report_value`, and `observe` on a plain
  variable are observer special forms** — compiler-resolved to the named
  binding's slot trajectory, like the predicates and interrogatives; a
  user rebinding does not change them (W013 now warns on the attempt).
  Documented in BUILTINS.md and DIAGNOSTICS.md.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-07-06

### Changed
- **BREAKING — one call rule (#405, closes #153): a bare literal list
  after `of` is ALWAYS an argument list**, at every element count:
  `f of []` is zero arguments, `f of [x]` is ONE argument (the element —
  previously it bound the whole 1-element list to the first parameter),
  `f of [a, b]` is two. Brackets are an argument list; parentheses are
  one argument — `f of ([x])` (#355) still passes a literal list whole.
  The obvious recursive form `fib of [n - 1]` now works even after a
  defaulted parameter is added (the arity-dependent silent-wrong this
  kills). Migration: every behavior-changed site is a bare 1-element
  literal arg list — the new **W017** lint flags exactly that shape with
  the two unambiguous rewrites (`f of x` / `f of ([x])`), so `--lint`
  over a repo is the mechanical audit. SPEC/COMPARISON call sections
  rewritten.

### Added
- **W017 — bare 1-element literal arg list** (#405): warns on `f of [x]`
  (historically ambiguous; inverted meaning pre-#405) and names both
  unambiguous spellings — `f of x` for one argument, `f of ([x])` to
  pass a 1-element list. Doubles as the #405 migration audit over a
  consumer repo.
- **E003 — undefined-name lint, increment one of the scope-aware
  name-resolution pass** (#404): `--lint` (and the LSP, as red squiggles)
  now reports a name that is read but bound nowhere — the typo'd name in a
  cold branch that a dynamic language otherwise carries to runtime. The
  binding set is a deliberate whole-file over-approximation (silent on
  outward-`is`, `local` shadowing, sibling-branch first assignment; a false
  positive is the failure mode that breaks consumer CI, so the pass always
  fails open). Builtins come from `register_builtins()` itself on a scratch
  env — never a hand list (the old lint.c copy had drifted ~120 names and
  carried a phantom `"error"` entry). Extension builtins bind by name via
  the new `src/ext_names.h` X-lists, which the gfx/http/db/model registrars
  now expand too, so registration and name-resolution cannot drift; the
  lint describes the language surface, not one binary's build flags.
  Literal `load_file of "path"` is resolved with the runtime's own
  resolution chain and its top-level binders collected transitively, so
  entry-point files assembling a program from parts lint clean. `eval` or a
  computed `load_file` path disables the pass for the file (documented
  dynamic escape). E003 is error-severity: it fails `--lint` even at
  `--lint-level error`. Full model in docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md.
- **`# lint: allow-file <CODE>...` file-wide suppression** — the escape for
  module *fragments* (files a loader `load_file`s into scope the loader
  provides, e.g. `lib/ui_w_*.eigs`), honored by both `--lint` and the LSP.
  `lib/invariant.eigs` instead became self-contained (it now loads
  `lib/observer.eigs` for `cs_signature` — pure defines, idempotent).
- **Interactive REPL line editor** (#392) — the REPL on a tty now has
  history (in-memory + `EIGS_HISTORY` file, default
  `~/.eigenscript_history`, created `0600`), arrow-key cursor editing,
  Home/End/Delete, Ctrl-A/E/U/K/W/L, Ctrl-C line-and-block cancel, and tab
  completion over builtins + session bindings (both are env bindings, so
  one walk covers them). Zero new link dependencies: a raw-termios editor
  in the new CLI-only `src/repl.c` (ported from the EigenOS console
  editor), not readline/libedit — the embed/freestanding profiles never
  see it. Piped/non-tty sessions keep the old fgets loop byte-for-byte
  (`EIGS_REPL_PLAIN=1` forces it on a tty). Interactive sessions record
  assignment history from the start, so `prev of x` works on session
  bindings instead of silently answering from no history. Suite section
  [42c] drives the editor on a real pty (`tests/test_repl.py`) and pins
  the piped transcript as a byte-exact golden.

### Fixed
- **Four silent-wrong-answer builtin contracts** (#312, #314, #316, #317),
  batch-fixed after the 2026-07 backlog triage:
  - `min`/`max` are now true N-ary reductions over a flat list of numbers
    (#317). The old code read only the first two elements — `max of [1, 2, 3]`
    returned **2** — and returned `0` for a 1-element list. Now
    `min of [5]` → `5`, `max of [1, 2, 3]` → `3`, and a bare number returns
    itself (mirroring `sum`); an empty list or a non-number element keeps
    the documented `0` fallback.
  - The string predicates `index_of`/`contains`/`starts_with`/`ends_with`
    reject non-string operands (#316) instead of folding them to `""`,
    which spuriously matched everything (`index_of of [[1,2,3], 2]` returned
    `0` — "found at index 0" — in violation of its "or -1" contract). Misses
    now answer `-1` (`index_of`) / `0` (the predicates).
  - `get_at`/`set_at`/`char_at` honor negative indices exactly like the `[]`
    operator (#312) — `get_at of [xs, -1]` is the last element (was: silent
    `0`/no-op/`""`), including the 2-D `get_at`/`set_at` row/col paths.
    Out-of-range indices keep the old miss defaults.
  - Passing a directory as the script path exits `1` with the clean
    `Error: cannot read file '...'` path (#314) instead of SIGABRT via a
    bogus 9-exabyte `xmalloc` (`ftell` on a directory reports `LONG_MAX`);
    `read_file_util` now rejects non-regular files up front, which covers
    `load_file` and the `--fmt`/`--lint` paths too.

### Changed
- **`chr` is the byte-writing inverse of `ord`** (#435): `chr of n` now emits
  the raw byte for any integer 1–255 (was: silent `""` for anything above
  127). Everything else raises loudly — 0 (strings are NUL-terminated),
  negatives, fractions (previously truncated silently), values above 255
  (the error points at `utf8_encode` for codepoints), and non-numbers.
  `chr of n` == `str_from_bytes of [n]` across the shared range.

### Added
- **Trace-tape format versioning** (#411): every tape now opens with a
  `V <format> <runtime>` header (both the hosted `EIGS_TRACE` file and the
  embed sink), and replay refuses a tape whose format or runtime version
  doesn't match the running binary — missing/malformed/mismatched headers
  exit with status 3 (hosted) or reject the tape at `eigs_set_replay_tape`
  (embed, returns 0). Version-and-reject, no migration, no override flag;
  the decision and the residual dev-build honesty gap are recorded in
  docs/TRACE.md. Pre-#411 (headerless) tapes are no longer replayable.
  Hardened by adversarial review: an unopenable `EIGS_REPLAY` path is now
  fatal too (was warn-and-run-live — the same silent divergence); the
  embed install validates *every* session header of a concatenated
  journal up front and swaps atomically (a refused/OOM install leaves the
  previously active tape and strict mode untouched, and can never abort
  the host mid-eval); torn mid-stream `V` lines refuse instead of
  slipping through the record filter; and `--version`/`--help` are
  handled before `trace_init` so a stale exported `EIGS_REPLAY` can't
  take down pure queries.
- **W016 — bare-predicate aliasing fence** (#396, completing it): a bare
  trajectory predicate outside a loop condition (`if stable:`,
  `ok is converged`, `return diverging`) reads the last-observed binding —
  the #247/#262 invisible-alias family — and now warns: write
  `<predicate> of <var>`. Loop conditions stay exempt (single-assign
  `loop while not converged` is the documented idiom; the ambiguous
  multi-assign case is already W014, no double-fire). Any explicit subject
  counts as named (incl. the `stable of (x + 0.0)` #262 workaround);
  deliberate bare reads use `# lint: allow W016` (#399). Zero firings
  across `lib/` + `examples/` and the consumer corpora; surfaces in
  `--lint --json` and eigenlsp via the shared pipeline.
- **`utf8_encode` / `utf8_from_codepoints`** in `lib/utf8.eigs` (#435): the
  encode half of the #416 module — codepoint(s) → UTF-8 byte string, built on
  `str_from_bytes`. #435's premise was a misdiagnosis: high bytes were already
  constructible via `str_from_bytes` (#248); encode had been omitted on that
  mistaken belief.
- **Parse errors carry `line:col`** (#407, first increment): the lexer already
  tracked columns; now the two parser diagnostics surface them. Human output
  reads `Parse error line 6:9: …`, the `--lint --json` `E002` element gains a
  1-based `"column"` field, and the LSP diagnostic range starts at that column
  instead of 0. Per-warning spans, runtime-error columns, and caret rendering
  remain the rest of #407. (`docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` records the `--json` contract
  change.)
- **`observer_slots.verdict of i`** — the full trajectory-regime string for a
  slot (was deferred on #383). Investigating #383 showed `report of <name>`
  inside a function *does* resolve the module binding's slot correctly and agrees
  with the predicates — the reported divergence did not reproduce (it was a
  constant reading as "equilibrium", which also satisfies `stable`, misread as a
  resolution bug). Verified with a descending signal reading "improving" (not the
  value-fallback), single-file and via `load_file`. Suite [50i] now 11 checks.
- **Unicode/text position settled: bytes-forever + `lib/utf8.eigs`** (#416).
  SPEC.md gains a "Text" subsection making `str`-is-a-byte-string official — byte
  indexing, multibyte-safe concat/f-strings — with byte-checked examples, and the
  new `lib/utf8.eigs` gives character semantics over the byte string
  (`utf8_len`/`utf8_codepoints`/`utf8_at`/`utf8_char_at`/`utf8_validate`, tested
  against published U+00E9/U+20AC/U+10348 vectors, suite [50k]). Native
  UTF-8-by-construction is deliberately not adopted (it would ripple through
  VM/JIT/AOT/tools). Building the module surfaced a real gap, filed rather than
  worked around: `chr` can't emit bytes ≥ 0x80, so `utf8_encode` (and byte-output
  generally) waits on #435.
- **Numeric model documented as a deliberate position** (#417): SPEC.md gains a
  "numeric model" subsection stating the contracts one f64 number kind buys —
  integer exactness ends at 2^53, arithmetic is finite by construction (`NaN`
  collapses to `0`, overflow saturates at ±1e308, never `Infinity`), and integer
  bitwise ops act on int64 (exact past 2^32) — with byte-checked examples. The
  decision: no bigint/decimal until a consumer forces it (it would ripple through
  the JIT and AOT); the wording avoids overcommitting "num IS f64" so a future
  wider kind stays possible. Roadmap item updated from a one-liner to the decided
  position.
- **`bench/` perf harness + a regression-gated `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`** (#398):
  performance as an executable, gated fact rather than a README claim. Two
  metrics on purpose — `bench/run_bench.sh` reports wall-clock n=5 medians (the
  human-facing PERFORMANCE.md numbers, environment-dependent), while the CI gate
  (`bench/check_regression.sh`) compares **deterministic cachegrind instruction
  counts** of the commit against origin/main, both built in the same runner, so a
  regression is a diffable fact and the gate never flakes on runner load. A
  `--selftest` builds a 2x-work workload and asserts it is flagged (the gate
  isn't vacuous). Workloads include observed-vs-unobserved, making the observer
  cost an executable document: ~28% wall-clock / ~46% instructions.
- **`docs/llms.txt` — single-file language reference for LLMs** (#403): the whole
  surface a model needs to generate correct `.eigs`, distilled to the traps
  where Python/JS habits fail — the `of`/one-element-spread rule, the
  outward-mutating scope model (`local` in helpers), reserved/soft keywords, the
  observer idioms, and an explicit **generate-then-validate ladder**
  (`--lint --json` → run → `--test`, the parse→compile→sandbox grading). Linked
  from the README; a doc-drift check stamps it to the current version so it
  can't silently fall behind the language. (Writing it caught a wrong idiom in
  its own draft — `1/0` warns and returns 0 rather than throwing, so the
  try/catch example now raises with `throw of` explicitly.)
- **COMPARISON.md "Convergence loops" section** (#402): the observer's everyday
  payoff, framed as boilerplate deletion before any theory — the same Newton's
  square root in Python (hand-rolled epsilon threshold, remembered previous
  value, max-iteration guard) versus EigenScript's `loop while not converged`,
  byte-checked under the doc-examples gate. New
  `examples/observer_vs_boilerplate.eigs`; README links the pragmatic comparison
  ahead of the OBSERVER.md theory.
- **First-run tooling unification** (#400): `install.sh` now builds and installs
  the `eigenlsp` language server alongside the interpreter (via a new
  `./build.sh lsp` mode, gcc-only, reusing build.sh's source list). The two
  parallel VS Code extension trees are collapsed into one canonical
  `editors/vscode/` that ships `extension.js` — a bundled client auto-launching
  `eigenlsp` on `.eigs` files; the drifted `editor/` duplicate is deleted. A new
  `install-smoke` CI job asserts the canonical tree wires the LSP client and that
  a fresh `install.sh` leaves both binaries on `PATH`.
- **docs/CONCURRENCY.md + a ThreadSanitizer race gate** (#401): the memory-model
  contract, written down at last — messages (channel sends, joined results) are
  deep-COPIED (`val_clone_for_send`, share-nothing); a spawned closure SHARES the
  parent heap by reference (races are yours); the first `spawn` flips the runtime
  to interpreter-only (#297 gates the JIT/OSR/IC off — the MT perf cliff); and
  `recv`/spawn handles raise loudly under `EIGS_REPLAY` (#148). Its examples are
  byte-exact under the doc-examples gate ([89]). The #297 "TSan-clean" claim was
  only a code comment; now `make tsan` + `tests/test_tsan.sh` (CI `tsan` job)
  run the spawn/channel slice under ThreadSanitizer (`setarch -R`) and prove it
  race-free — and a deliberately seeded race (`tests/tsan_seeded_race.eigs`) is
  asserted to be caught, so the gate can't rot into a vacuous pass.

### Fixed
- **Infix shift undefined behavior — shift counts now masked `& 63`.** The
  `bit_shl`/`bit_shr` builtins already masked the count to `[0,63]`, but the
  infix `<<`/`>>` operators did not: `1 << 64` (and any count ≥ 64 or a negative
  count) was C undefined behavior on the `int64` path. No suite case exercised a
  count ≥ 64, so UBSan stayed quiet over a real latent bug. Both paths now mask
  identically, honoring the `docs/LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md` "shifts are defined, not
  UB" promise; `tests/test_bitwise.eigs` gains the ≥ 64 cases for the infix
  operators (`1 << 64 == 1`, `1 << 100 == 2^36`) proving parity with the
  builtins. Behavior on x86-64 is unchanged (the hardware already masked mod-64);
  the fix makes it defined rather than accidental.
- **Data race in `channel_closed`** — it read `ch->closed` without the channel
  mutex while `close_channel` wrote it under the lock. Single-core timing hid it
  locally; the new #401 TSan gate caught it on its first CI run (two workers
  polling `channel_closed` against a concurrent `close`). Now reads under the
  lock. This was the one real gap behind the "#297 TSan-clean" claim.
- **`--lint` severity control + inline suppression** (#399): `--lint-level
  error|warning` chooses the exit-1 threshold — `error` makes warnings advisory
  (still printed / in `--json`, but exit 0 unless an error-severity diagnostic
  is present), so a consumer can wire `--lint --json` into CI for diagnostics
  without warnings-as-errors. A `# lint: allow W001` comment (space/comma-
  separated codes, or `all`) silences those codes on its line and the line below
  — trailing or above the flagged construct — removing them from human and
  `--json` output. docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md "Severity control and suppression";
  test_lint.sh both-ways coverage. (This is the suppression escape hatch W016
  was waiting on.) Per-file `eigs.json` allow-lists remain open on #399 as a
  contributor on-ramp.
- **`make lib` + two-file amalgamation — the embeddable artifact** (#397):
  `make amalgamation` writes `build/eigenscript_all.c` (every runtime source and
  header inlined into one self-contained translation unit, optional extensions
  defaulted off) plus the public `build/eigs_embed.h`. Copy the two files and
  compile with `cc` alone — no `-I`, no `-D`, no source list — the Lua-grade
  drop-in. `make lib` produces `libeigenscript.a`. The amalgamator reads its
  source list from the Makefile's `SOURCES` (no second list to drift), and
  `make embed-smoke` now links against the amalgamation so the artifact can't
  silently rot. New "Drop-in" quickstart in docs/EMBEDDING.md;
  tests/test_amalgamation.sh proves the fresh-dir `cc`-alone build; CI covers
  `make lib` and the drop-in.
- **`--test --trace-on-fail` — every failure is a replayable tape** (#394):
  records each test into its own tape via a new `--trace <path>` CLI flag (the
  twin of `EIGS_TRACE`). A passing test discards its tape; a failing one keeps
  it and prints the exact `EIGS_REPLAY=<tape> eigenscript <file>` invocation that
  reproduces the failure byte-for-byte — the same random draw, clock read, and
  file bytes come off the tape. `--json` results carry a per-test `tape` field
  for CI archival. Proven by a transcript byte-diff oracle
  (`tests/test_trace_on_fail.sh`, suite [42b]) on both execution tiers (JIT on
  and `EIGS_JIT_OFF`) and under `EIGS_REPLAY_STRICT`; new "Every Failure is a
  Tape" section in docs/TRACE.md with the same-binary (#411) caveat; a CI leg
  records and uploads a tape artifact.
- **Lint W015 — function-clobber fence** (`src/lint.c`, advances #396): a
  function that assigns (without `local`) over a module-level *function* name
  silently reassigns it via mutate-outward, so later `<fn> of ...` calls fail.
  W015 flags exactly that. It is deliberately scoped to function clobbering: the
  broad "any outer mutation" reading is refuted by the corpus — under
  mutate-outward, reusing a generic module *variable* name inside a function is
  pervasive and almost always benign (155 such firings across working examples),
  so flagging it would be noise. `_`-prefixed names (intentional module state,
  as W001 already honors) are skipped. The general local-discipline lint is
  #404's dataflow-aware territory. Surfaces in the editor via the shared
  `lint_collect` path; docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md entries for W014 and W015 (W014 was
  missing). Firing + non-firing fixtures in test_lint.sh; zero false positives
  across lib/ + examples/.
- **Stdlib/builtin discoverability gate** (`tools/stdlib_index_check.sh`, #393):
  every builtin registered in `src/builtins.c` must appear in the reference docs
  (BUILTINS.md / SPEC.md / STDLIB.md) and every `lib/*.eigs` module must have a
  STDLIB.md heading — undiscoverable breadth is zero breadth. The gate ships a
  `--selftest` proving it flags an injected undocumented builtin, and runs in the
  suite as [99b] beside the doc-drift gate. Backfilled the six builtins it caught
  (`dispatch`, `nearest_in_range_all`, `proc_read_buf`, `read_bytes`, `reshape`,
  `secure_equals`) into docs/BUILTINS.md.
- **`lib/contract.eigs`** — trajectory contracts (#395): `require`/`ensure`
  (plain predicates) plus the observer-native differentiators
  `expect_converging`, `expect_monotone`, and `invariant_stable`. Each drives a
  seed through a one-arg step function into an observed local and asserts a
  property of that trajectory — convergence/monotonicity/stability — that no
  type grammar can state. Two observer truths are baked in: convergence is read
  on the **value channel**, because a monotonically exploding value reads
  `converged` on the entropy channel (the #294 blind spot — a contract `report`
  would silently pass); and a non-scalar accumulator is refused loudly rather
  than classified `equilibrium` forever as a silent no-op. Worked solver:
  `examples/stem/contract_solver.eigs`; new "Contracts" section in
  docs/OBSERVER.md; suite [50j]. An adversarial verification sweep hardened the
  module: the scalar guard fires on every step's output (not just the seed), a
  `max_obs` below the observer window is rejected rather than vacuously passing,
  and `expect_converging` requires a genuine "converged" verdict instead of
  accepting a "stable" slow-runaway. Surfaced two upstream gaps rather than
  working around them: #421 (the observer slot is binding-identity, so a value's
  history can't be inspected by a function it is passed to) and #422 (the value
  channel's relative-delta normalization is blind to sub-exponential divergence
  and sub-deadband oscillation).

### Fixed
- **`lib/tensor.eigs` — `xavier_init`/`he_init` clobbered the module `scale`
  function.** Both used a bare `scale is ...` local; because `scale` is also a
  top-level function, mutate-outward destroyed it, so a `scale of [t, s]` call
  after either initializer would fail. Now `local scale`. Found by the new W015.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Stdlib backlog train** (from the cross-repo pattern survey):
  `lib/bcd.eigs` (packed BCD any width, loud rejection of invalid
  nibbles — CMOS RTC + Game Boy DAA), `functional.wait_until` (the
  bounded-poll shape; caller supplies the sleep primitive),
  `format.hexdump` (offset/hex/ascii rows over strings or buffers),
  `lib/harness.eigs` (the count-and-continue twin-gate scaffolding
  extracted from six hand-rolled EigenOS harnesses), and
  `lib/observer_slots.eigs` (eight named observer slots behind index
  dispatch — the #262 trajectory-identity trap encoded once; verdict()
  deferred on the #383 report-of resolution asymmetry found while
  building it). Suite sections [50e]-[50i].
- **`lib/checksum.eigs`** — CRC-32 (reflected 0xEDB88320, table-driven),
  Adler-32, and `sum8` over strings or buffers; results unsigned 32-bit.
  Byte-integrity math written once: regionfs hand-rolls Adler-32 today,
  DMG needs the cartridge header sum, M13 networking wants CRC-32.
  Suite [50c] pins the published check values.
- **Civil-date math in `lib/datetime.eigs`** — the module's first PURE
  half (the clock functions shell out to `date` and are host-only):
  `days_from_civil`/`civil_from_days`, `weekday_from_days`,
  `epoch_from_civil`/`civil_from_epoch` (Hinnant's algorithms, exact
  integer arithmetic in doubles, every profile). EigenOS's rtc.eigs is
  the motivating consumer — CMOS registers to epoch seconds with no
  host clock. Suite [50d] pins leap edges and round-trips.

### Fixed
- **The `bit_*` builtins are now the same operation as the infix
  operators.** They were a second, divergent implementation — a
  `(uint32_t)(int32_t)` conversion that was undefined behavior for
  inputs ≥ 2^31 and sign-extended results — so `0xEDB88320 & x` worked
  while `bit_and of [0xEDB88320, x]` returned garbage (found by the
  CRC-32 stdlib module, the first consumer needing the full unsigned-32
  range). All six builtins now use the infix int64 two's-complement
  semantics; shift counts are real up to 63 (the old int32-era `&31`
  count masking — `bit_shl of [1, 32]` == 1 — is gone). test_bitwise
  gains an infix-vs-builtin equality battery over the high-bit range.
- **`num of` hex strings share the lexer's contract.** The string→number
  builtin delegated wholesale to `strtod`, so `num of "0x.8"` read 0.5
  and `num of "0x1p4"` read 16 hosted while the freestanding profile
  read 0 — the #378 divergence surviving through the string path. Hex
  strings now convert in the builtin itself on every profile: integer
  digits, stop at the first non-hex character ("0xFFzz" → 255,
  "0x1p4" → 1), prefix with no hex digit → 0 like any non-numeric
  string. Suite [50b] gains five conversion checks.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Async abort seam for embedders** (`eigs_set_abort_flag`). The host
  registers a flag it may set from an interrupt/signal context (SIGINT
  handler, timeout timer, bare-metal keyboard IRQ); the interpreter polls
  it on every loop back-edge and raises an ordinary `aborted` runtime
  error, consuming the flag — one set aborts exactly one eval and the
  state stays usable. Setting the flag is a plain store into the host's
  own int (async-signal-safe; the runtime only reads). Unregistered cost
  is one predicted-not-taken test per back-edge. Documented caveats:
  catchable like any runtime error; JIT/OSR-native loops don't poll
  (freestanding compiles the JIT out, so bare-metal coverage is total).
  Motivated by EigenOS: ctrl-c must break a runaway eval at the metal
  REPL instead of owning the machine. Covered by embed_smoke (pre-set +
  mid-eval interval-timer cases) and docs/EMBEDDING.md.

### Fixed
- **Hex integer literals are lexed explicitly, not delegated to `strtod`.**
  `0xFF` previously parsed only because glibc's C99 `strtod` accepts hex —
  the freestanding profile (mini_strtod, deliberately hex-free) lexed the
  same source as `0` + identifier `xFF`, so hex-using programs parsed
  hosted and broke on EigenOS (found by its M12 PCI port-I/O probe). The
  lexer now consumes `0x`/`0X` + hex digits itself on every profile, and
  the accidentally-accepted hex-FLOAT forms (`0x1p4`, `0xA.8`) are loud
  parse errors instead of numbers. New suite section [50b] pins the form.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-07-03

### Performance
- **Frameless leaf-accessor calls (#366).** Function chunks whose body is a
  single pure expression over their params — field gets, list/buffer index
  gets, numeric arithmetic, numeric constants ending in `return` — are
  flagged at compile time (`chunk_scan_leaf_accessor`) and exactly-fed calls
  execute directly against the caller's stack (`vm_leaf_accessor_exec`): no
  call env take/rebind/park, no frame push, no chunk refcount traffic, no
  dispatch in/out of the callee. Any runtime surprise (type mismatch,
  out-of-range index, missing-field chain) bails to the generic CALL path
  before touching the stack, so results, errors, and tracebacks are
  byte-identical. Measured on the EigenMiniSat-derived accessor micro-bench
  (200K-iteration loop, n=5 medians): call overhead vs the inlined
  expression drops from ~198ns to ~40ns per call (+44% loop penalty →
  ~+7%). Hooked in both the interpreter's `CASE(CALL)` and
  `jit_helper_call`, so interpreter-tier consumers (EigenOS) and JIT'd
  loops both benefit.

### Added
- **`hex of n` / `hex of [n, nibbles]` builtin.** Uppercase hex of a
  non-negative integer, optionally zero-padded (never truncated); raises
  on negatives, fractions, and non-numbers. Demanded by the emulator
  repos (DMG GAP-DMG-010) — addresses/opcodes/registers all want hex
  diagnostics and every consumer hand-rolled it.
- **Audio channel mixer: `audio_volume`, `audio_stop`, infinite loops
  (Tidepool GAP-002/GAP-003).** The audio device now runs a 16-channel
  callback mixer instead of SDL queue mode. `audio_play` /
  `audio_play_loop` return a channel id; `audio_play_loop of [clip, -1]`
  loops forever (the mixer rewinds — loop count no longer multiplies
  memory, so the old 256 MiB loops×len budget is gone);
  `audio_volume of [ch, vol]` adjusts a playing channel live (0.0–4.0);
  `audio_stop of ch` stops one channel. The pool always succeeds —
  when all 16 channels are busy the oldest finite one is recycled
  (callers historically ignore the return value, so refusal would be
  silent). `audio_queue_size` now reports unplayed bytes across active
  finite channels; `audio_clear` stops everything. Channel state is
  mutated only under `SDL_LockAudioDevice`.
- **Trace-tape seam in the embed API.** `eigs_set_trace_sink` streams every
  tape record (L/A/N lines) to a host callback as bytes, enabling recording
  with no filesystem; `eigs_set_replay_tape` hands a whole tape back as the
  in-memory replay source (nondet builtins serve the recorded `N` values in
  order, falling back to live at tape end); `eigs_replay_take` /
  `eigs_trace_record_nondet` let HOST-registered builtins participate in
  the tape with the same take/record contract the runtime's own nondet
  builtins use. This un-carves record/replay for the freestanding profile
  (EigenOS M11: the machine journal targets the M10 store). Hosted
  EIGS_TRACE / EIGS_REPLAY behavior unchanged; the strict-mismatch abort
  uses `abort()` freestanding (`_exit` is hosted-only). Covered in
  `embed_smoke.c` (record → sink, sink-off freeze, replay-served values vs
  an advancing live source, tape exhaustion, clear), documented in
  docs/EMBEDDING.md.
- **Buffer support in the embed API.** `eigs_value_new_buffer` /
  `eigs_value_buffer_len` / `eigs_value_buffer_get` / `eigs_value_buffer_set`
  plus `EIGS_TYPE_BUFFER` in the type enum — the script-side `buffer of n`
  value crossable at the host boundary with no copy (a host-built buffer
  passed to script is the same object `buf_set` mutates). Buffers are the
  NUL-safe binary carrier: this is the seam a block-device embedder
  (EigenOS M10, tidelog-as-filesystem) moves sectors through. Covered in
  `embed_smoke.c` (construction, OOB/wrong-type safety, shared-object
  mutation both directions), documented in docs/EMBEDDING.md.
- **Single-thread multi-state switching (`eigs_thread_switch`).** Parks the
  calling thread's current attachment (no teardown — arena, freelists, VM
  and error state live on the `EigsThread` and stay intact) and activates
  its attachment to another state, creating one on first switch; vm.c's
  `__thread` hot caches are reset per switch exactly as attach does. This is
  the cooperative-scheduler seam (EigenOS M9: a task IS an `EigsState`; a
  step is one eval; the scheduler is script). Rules: values never cross
  states (copy numbers out); `eigs_close` must run while attached to the
  closing state. Covered in embed_smoke: isolation both ways, bindings
  preserved across switches, process-global source provider serving every
  state, close-and-reactivate.
- **Embedder source provider — the module seam (`eigs_set_source_provider`).**
  `import name` now consults a host-registered provider FIRST in every build
  profile; the filesystem chain is the hosted fallback and is absent in the
  freestanding profile, where the provider is the only module source. This is
  the seam EigenOS's M7.5 "ROM bundle" plugs into (stdlib + programs baked
  into the kernel image, `import` working on bare metal with no filesystem —
  later re-backed by a real filesystem without changing the interface).
  Provider-served modules share the module cache (keyed under a
  `\x01provider:` prefix no real path can collide with); the provider's
  returned pointer is copied immediately, so static strings are ideal. The
  freestanding `import` error now names both causes. Covered hosted
  (embed_smoke) and freestanding (freestanding_smoke).

### Changed
- **Module functions can no longer bind writes through to the loader's
  globals (#373).** Whether a `load_file`'d (or `import`ed) module's
  function could clobber a caller global used to depend on load order:
  a global declared *before* the load was a compile-time write-through
  target (`in_globals` probed the live env during the module compile),
  one declared *after* was insulated — so a library's stray bare
  assignment silently corrupted exactly those caller globals that
  existed at load time (EigenRegex#5: the caller's `pos is 42` broke
  the regex engine's own matching). Module compiles now set a boundary
  flag: function-body writes to names that aren't local / captured /
  outer / the module's own top-level state compile as fresh locals,
  never as dynamic writes through the loader's env. Reads and calls
  still resolve dynamically across the boundary (cross-module reads,
  caller-provided hooks, and value mutation via index all work
  unchanged), top-level module statements still execute in the current
  scope, and same-file outward mutation — the documented scope model —
  is untouched. Compile-time only; zero runtime cost. The one stdlib
  consumer of the old write-through — the UI toolkit's 23 bare globals
  shared across its 18 files — migrated to a single `_ui` state dict
  (reads cross the boundary; field writes are value mutations), which
  is now the documented cross-file shared-state pattern (SPEC.md
  "Module write boundary").

### Changed
- **Parentheses always mean one argument (#355).** A parenthesized
  literal list no longer spreads: `f of ([a, b])` binds the whole list
  `[a, b]` to the first parameter, exactly as SPEC.md's `f of (x)`
  guidance always promised (previously parens were AST-transparent and
  the literal spread anyway, leaving **no syntax** to pass a literal
  2+-element list as a single argument to a multi-parameter function).
  `f of ([])` is likewise a one-argument call passing the empty list;
  bare `f of []` remains the zero-arg form and bare `f of [a, b]`
  still spreads. The meta-interpreter (lib/eigen.eigs) mirrors the rule
  (test_meta_parity), and SPEC.md / LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md / COMPARISON.md
  document it. The ouroboros AOT frontend mirrors this at its next
  runtime-pin bump, per the #326/#328 precedent.

### Fixed
- **`--lint` no longer reports false-positive `unused parameter` for
  uses inside `unobserved:` blocks (dynamics F-DYN-4).** The lint
  walkers didn't descend into `AST_UNOBSERVED` (same block shape as
  `AST_BLOCK`), so a parameter referenced only inside an `unobserved:`
  hot loop looked unused; `AST_SLICE` and `AST_LIST_PATTERN_ASSIGN`
  operands were invisible to use-analysis the same way. All three now
  traverse.
- **Parser caps fail loudly at the cap (#354).** A 17-parameter
  `define`/lambda or a 65-case `match` used to stop consuming at the cap
  and die in a stray-token error cascade that never mentioned the limit —
  a real hazard for generated code. Each now produces exactly one parse
  error naming the cap (`function exceeds 16 parameters`, `lambda exceeds
  16 parameters`, `match exceeds 64 cases`), draining the excess input so
  the diagnostic stands alone. The caps are now named constants
  (MAX_PARAMS, MAX_MATCH_CASES) and documented in SPEC.md's new
  "Syntactic limits" note alongside the existing 1024-element list cap.
- **ext_db raises instead of silently mangling queries (#356).** A query
  list with 17+ parameters silently dropped the extras (Postgres would
  then error confusingly at exec time, or worse, not at all), and a
  non-string/number parameter was silently sent as `""` (the #316
  coerce-to-empty class). Both now raise catchable errors naming the
  problem (`db: too many parameters (N, max 16)`, `db: parameter N is
  not a string or number`).
- **ext_http route registration raises on failure (#356).** A malformed
  route argument or the 257th route returned a silent `make_null()` that
  no caller checks — the route just never existed. Both now raise
  (`http_route requires [method, path, handler...]`, `http_route: route
  table full (max 256 routes)`).
- **gfx: `ppu_render_frame` window uses an internal line counter.** The
  window's row advances only on scanlines where it actually renders
  (resetting each frame), replacing the `ly - wy` approximation that
  misrendered mid-frame window toggles/WY changes. In lockstep with the
  script-PPU twin (DMG#18).
- **gfx: `ppu_render_frame` gates the window layer on LCDC bit 0.** On DMG
  hardware, LCDC bit 0 = 0 disables the window as well as the background;
  the native renderer drew the window whenever bit 5 was set. Kept in
  lockstep with the script-PPU twin (DMG#31).
- **`sort` no longer silently no-ops on non-numeric lists (#368).** The
  comparator returned 0 for any non-number pair, so sorting a list of
  records did nothing — with libc-dependent element order, since qsort
  guarantees nothing for all-equal elements. DMG shipped two
  silently-unsorted call sites on this (sprite X-priority — the very use
  case `sort` was added for — and input-script ordering; DMG#25/#26).
  `sort` now sorts all-number lists numerically (unchanged), sorts
  all-string lists lexicographically (making `lib/test_runner.eigs`'s
  directory discovery deterministic), and **raises** on mixed or
  non-scalar elements, naming the offending index/type and pointing at
  `sort_by` (stable, numeric-keyed) for records.
- **The compiler no longer costs ~12.7 KiB of C stack per AST level — the
  EigenOS "#UD heisenbug" root cause.** `Compiler` embedded
  `Local locals[512]` (12 KiB) by value, and `compile_node_inner`
  stack-declares a `Compiler` for every nested function — so compiling even
  a 5-deep AST used ~64 KiB of C stack. Hosted 8 MiB stacks never noticed;
  on EigenOS's 64 KiB boot stack the overflow (no guard page on bare metal)
  silently trampled the `.bss` sections below the stack, producing the
  layout-sensitive delayed `#UD` wild-dispatch documented in EigenOS
  KNOWN_ISSUES — the fault was deterministic per build, moved with every
  rebuild, and survived heap/stack zeroing, which had mis-pointed the
  diagnosis at an uninitialized read. Poison-fill (`make poison`, new) +
  `MALLOC_PERTURB_` + Valgrind on a new embed-API REPL soak exonerated the
  allocation layers, and rerunning the soak under `ulimit -s 64` reproduced
  the crash hosted in `compile_node_inner`'s prologue. The `locals` array is
  now heap-allocated per compiler (`compile_node_inner` frame: 12,704 →
  1,440 bytes; `compile_ast`: 12,576 → 304; worst-case compile stack at
  `COMPILE_MAX_DEPTH` 128: ~1.6 MiB → ~184 KiB). Regression:
  `tools/embed_stack_soak.sh` (CI, freestanding job) runs a 104-step
  REPL-accumulation soak through `eigs_eval_string` — the pattern the suite
  never exercises (one script per process) — inside a 64 KiB stack rlimit;
  it SIGSEGVs without this fix.

### Added
- **`make poison` — uninitialized-read hunter build.** Fills `xmalloc`
  blocks, `xrealloc` grown tails, and the env freelist's parked dormant
  arrays (`names`/`values`/`assign_counts` + hash `hashes`/`indices`; the
  generation gate itself is untouched) with `0xAA`, so a read of
  never-initialized or stale-gated memory misbehaves deterministically on
  every link layout instead of reading glibc's benign zero pages — the
  MSan-shaped bug class the ASan/UBSan gates can't see, surfaced by the
  EigenOS bare-metal port. Pairs with `MALLOC_PERTURB_` at suite time
  (documented on the target); zero cost when off. The full suite passes
  under poison + perturb.
- **#326 gap closed: member-assign statements enforce the terminator (#351).**
  The dot-/index-assignment statement paths missed the v0.23.0 check —
  `d.a is 2 3`, `l[0] is 8 9`, and `d.a += 5 6` still silently ran the
  trailing token as a second statement, and diverged from the
  meta-interpreter (which already gated these points, so `eigen_run`
  rejected what the C parser accepted). Both paths now call
  `p_end_statement`. Found during the ouroboros v0.23.0 pin bump; its
  frontend carries a `stmt_terminator_gap.eigs` canary that must be flipped
  (gap-exemption removed) at the next EIGS_REF bump. Regression: 4 checks
  added to section [113].

## [0.23.0] - 2026-07-01

### Performance
- **Compile time is linear in program size (#341).** Profiling (gprof, the
  12k-unique-name generated program) refuted the issue's suspect: 92% of
  compile time was `chunk_add_constant`'s linear dedup scan over the constant
  pool, with `name_set_add` (the filed suspect) second at 3% — and dominant
  only after the first fix. Both are now hash-indexed (open addressing;
  constant equality is byte-for-byte the old scan's tests, so pools stay
  identical — NaN still never dedups, -0.0 still merges with +0.0, and the
  AOT byte-parity contract is safe). The NameSet index also replaces the
  direct swap-removal at the param-filter sites with `name_set_remove`
  (rebuilds the index). Medians (n=5, N3350): 12k statements 8.76s → 0.07s
  (~125×); 3k/6k/12k now scale linearly (0.01/0.03/0.07s); 30k runs in 0.2s.

### Fixed
- **An out-of-range `OP_SET_LOCAL` is a runtime error (#348).** A slot ≥
  `env->count` silently DROPPED the write — the assigned variable simply
  never came into existence. Compiler-emitted writes are always backed (body
  locals size the call env; defaults-bearing chunks reserve their param
  slots), so the drop only hit hand-built bytecode (`vm_run_bytecode`
  descriptors, the ouroboros codegen): a defaults prologue on an underfed
  call wrote into a nonexistent slot and continued unbound (F-OURO-22;
  ouroboros pads a spare local as a workaround it can drop at the next pin
  bump). Now a catchable `SET_LOCAL slot N out of range` error.
  **`OP_GET_LOCAL`'s out-of-range null push stays, deliberately** — the fix
  originally made it an error too and 18 call-semantics checks failed: that
  null IS the "missing parameters bind to null" semantics for underfed calls
  to defaults-free functions (now documented at the handler). The JIT scan
  additionally refuses to compile local ops whose slot ≥
  `chunk->local_count` (the emitter reads/writes `env->values[slot]`
  unchecked — a violating JIT'd chunk was native out-of-bounds access, not
  even a silent drop); those ops interpret instead. Regression: 2 checks in
  `test_vm_run_bytecode.eigs` [93].
- **Constant pool past 65536 entries is a compile error, not a wrap (#341).**
  Constant indices are u16 operands; a pool crossing 65536 silently wrapped
  the emitted index, and a wrapped SET_NAME operand landing on a NUM constant
  made `const_interns[idx]` NULL — SEGV in `env_hash_name` (reachable since
  #327 removed the statement cap; found running the 100k-statement probe).
  The compiler now reports `constant pool exceeds 65536 entries in one chunk`
  once and aborts via the post-compile gate. Regression: section [114]
  (generated at test time). Widening to a 32-bit operand (`OP_CONST_WIDE`)
  is the future lift if a real consumer needs it.

### Documentation
- **GRAMMAR.md brought back in sync with the parser (#329, #330, #331, #332,
  #333).** It was frozen at "v0.8.0+" while the parser grew: added the four
  bitwise precedence levels (`|` `^` `&` `<<`/`>>` between comparison and
  addition) and unary `~`; compound assignment (`+=` family, incl. dot/index
  targets); slices; destructuring; index assignment; parameter defaults; the
  IDENT-rooted restriction on dot/index assignment targets (#332); the true
  postfix applicability matrix (#329: NUM/STR/list literals take subscripts
  only; f-strings and soft-keyword fallbacks take full postfix); the `of`
  precedence-table row corrected Left→Right (#333); the named-parameter
  "unpack" note replaced with the real literal-only spread rule; and the
  extended numeric-literal forms (#331: `.5`, `1.`, `1e5`, `0x10` via strtod)
  documented in both GRAMMAR.md and SPEC.md. The zero-parameter lambda's
  implicit `n` (#330) is now documented in SPEC.md as deliberate
  classic-style mirroring. Statement-terminator and break/continue rules
  cross-referenced (#326/#337).

### Fixed
- **The statement terminator is enforced (#326).** Every statement path ended
  in a tolerant `p_match(TOK_NEWLINE)`, so the NEWLINE in the documented
  grammar (`program = { statement NEWLINE }`) was never required — any
  leftover tokens on a line silently parsed as a *second* statement:
  `x is 2 x is 3` set x to 3, `y is 2 3` discarded the 3, and the typo'd
  `throw "boom"` (missing `of`) evaluated `throw` and `"boom"` as two
  discarded expressions — silently disabling error handling. A statement must
  now end at NEWLINE/EOF/DEDENT (`Parse error line N: unexpected X after
  statement — one statement per line`), with recovery to end-of-line so one
  bad line yields one diagnostic; `break`/`continue`/`import` enforce it too
  (`break 5` no longer runs `5` as a statement). The meta-interpreter's
  parser (`lib/eigen.eigs`) enforces the same rule at its eight simple-
  statement return points — accepting the shape there would be a silent
  over-acceptance divergence. GRAMMAR.md and SPEC.md already promised this
  ("a statement ends at the end of its line"); the implementation now
  matches. Known #315 (`1.2.3` silently splitting) is fixed as a side
  effect: the second half is now a parse error. Regression: section [113]
  (`test_stmt_terminator.eigs`) + `examples/errors/two_statements_one_line.eigs`
  gated by [90]. NOTE for ouroboros: `frontend.eigs` currently mirrors the
  old tolerant behavior and must land the same enforcement (tracked in
  ouroboros#57) or VM-vs-AOT acceptance diverges.
- **`break`/`continue` outside a loop are now compile errors (#337).** They
  compiled to silent no-ops (an explicit `OP_NULL`), so a mis-indented `break`
  left its loop spinning with no diagnostic — including inside a function body
  with no loop of its own (a break there never crosses frames to the caller's
  loop). Both now report `Compile error line N: 'break' outside a loop` and
  abort via the existing post-compile gate. The same gate is now enforced at
  every dynamic entry point: `eval`, `load_file`, and `import` previously
  checked `g_parse_errors` only after *parse*, so compile-stage diagnostics
  executed a placeholder chunk anyway — all three now fail with a catchable
  error. Module-level `return` (ends the program, value discarded, exit 0) is
  now documented in SPEC.md's Program model. Regression: section [112]
  (`test_stray_break.eigs`) + two new `examples/errors/` demos gated by [90].
- **f-string interpolation: whitespace and nested-string braces (#334).** Two
  lexer defects. (1) `f"{ x }"` (leading space) failed with "unexpected indent
  in expression": the interpolation body is re-lexed as a fresh source string
  and the splice loop dropped NEWLINE but not INDENT/DEDENT, so the leading
  space lexed as line-start indentation. All three layout tokens are now
  skipped. (2) The brace scanner counted `{`/`}` byte-wise, so a brace inside a
  *string literal within the interpolation* terminated the expression early
  (`f"{"a}b"}"` → unterminated-string errors). String literals are now copied
  wholesale (with escape handling); nested f-strings still balance via depth
  counting. Regression: 6 new checks in `test_fstrings.eigs` [21].
- **Soft-keyword identifier fallback now takes postfix (#328).** `prev`, `at`,
  and the six question words fall back to ordinary identifiers outside their
  special forms, but the fallback returned a bare IDENT with no postfix chain —
  `prev is [1,2]` then `prev[0]` was a parse-error cascade while `prev + 1`
  worked. All soft-keyword fallbacks now share the IDENT branch's postfix
  chain (`[i]`, `[a:b]`, `.key`) via a new `parse_postfix_chain` helper; the
  special forms (`prev of x`, `what is e`) still win. Regression: SK13-SK18 in
  `test_soft_keyword_idents.eigs`.
- **Meta-interpreter: silent wrong values eliminated (#338).** Two undocumented
  divergences in `lib/eigen.eigs` produced wrong results with no error on
  identical source. (1) The tokenizer's final branch *skipped* unknown
  characters, so unsupported operators silently mangled: `x += 2` lexed as a
  discarded `x + 2` (variable unchanged), `5 & 3` as two statements (`a is 5`),
  dot/index compound forms likewise. The tokenizer now **raises** a tokenize
  error on any character it can't lex (`\r` treated as whitespace); compound
  assignment and bitwise stay unimplemented but fail loudly. (2) `eigen_eval`'s
  call node spread *any runtime list* over multi-param functions; the C rule is
  literal-only (2+ elements, decided at the call-site AST; a variable list
  binds whole to the first parameter; missing parameters bind to null). The
  meta call node now checks the argument NODE and null-fills, matching the VM
  on all four shapes (literal spread / variable no-spread / 1-element literal /
  short-spread null-fill — each verified against the C VM). Header parity
  claims updated; loud parse gaps (slices, destructuring, param defaults,
  `<<`/`>>`) remain tracked as #339. Regression: 7 new checks in section [107]
  (`test_meta_parity.eigs`).
- **Parser statement cap removed (#327).** `parse()` and `parse_block` stored
  statements into fixed 4096-entry arrays and silently discarded everything
  past the cap — a 100k-statement program ran only its first 4096 statements
  and exited 0; a `define` body past the cap lost its tail *including its
  `return`* and yielded null. Both arrays now grow on demand (and no longer
  preallocate 32KB per block — 256-deep nesting used to reserve ~8MB up
  front). Exactly the wrong failure mode for generated programs (iLambdaAi).
  Regression: section [111] (`test_stmt_cap.eigs`) — a 4200-statement program
  and a 4200-statement function body run in full. Note: removing the cap
  exposes a pre-existing quadratic compile cost on programs with tens of
  thousands of *unique* module-scope names (NameSet linear-scan dedup) —
  tracked separately; normal programs are unaffected.
- **Compiler loop-context caps removed (#335, #336).** Two fixed-size arrays in
  the compiler silently degraded on big/deep loops. (1) `MAX_BREAK_JUMPS` (64):
  break #65+ in one loop emitted its `OP_LOOP_ENV_END` cleanup but *dropped the
  jump* — execution fell through into the rest of the iteration with the loop
  env already torn down, and the loop's natural exit freed it again (runtime
  `double free or corruption`, SIGABRT, on well-formed source). (2)
  `MAX_LOOP_DEPTH` (32): loops nested deeper pushed no `LoopCtx`, so a `break`
  inside loop 33+ registered with the **32nd** loop's context and got patched to
  its exit — wrong jump target plus unpopped iterator state corrupting outer
  iterations, rc=0. Both are now dynamic: the loop stack is a grown array of
  heap-allocated contexts (pointers, so an outer loop's ctx can't dangle when a
  nested loop grows the stack) and `break_jumps` grows per context; everything
  frees when the outermost loop pops, so no compiler-teardown changes. A break's
  env cleanup and its jump are now emitted unconditionally as a pair.
  Regression: section [110] (`test_loop_caps.eigs`) — the 65th break executing
  in a for-loop and a while-loop, and a break inside a 33-deep nest exiting
  exactly one loop. Found in an adversarial language review.
- **`throw` now halts the caller's remaining statements (#322).** A `throw` that
  propagated out of a *called* function did not stop the **calling** function
  from running its subsequent statements — execution (including side-effecting
  builtin calls) continued until the nearest enclosing `try`, or the function
  returned. `CHECK_ERROR` (the per-instruction error hook) only caught in the
  *throwing* frame or halted when no handler existed anywhere; when a handler
  existed only in an **outer** frame it fell through and kept executing the
  current frame. Fix: `CHECK_ERROR` is now a loop that, for that missing case,
  unwinds the current frame (drains its stack window, frees an owned env,
  restores its loop-stall globals, drops its chunk ref — mirroring the uncaught
  `vm_error_halt` per-frame drain) and re-checks at the caller, repeating until
  it reaches the handler frame (catch) or runs out (halt). The control case
  (throw directly in a `try` body) and the uncaught case were already correct
  and are unchanged; a callee that catches its own error still doesn't
  over-unwind. Since `DISPATCH` runs `CHECK_ERROR` before every instruction, the
  fix covers the whole interpreter; JIT-hot throwing chains bail to the
  interpreter and propagate correctly too. Regression: section [109]
  (`test_throw_unwind`) — multi-level nesting, throw-in-a-loop-in-a-function,
  inner-catch (no over-unwind), and a JIT-hot chain. Surfaced while fixing #306.
- **`sandbox_run` allocation budget (#292).** The sandbox bounded loop back-edges
  and the builtin surface but imposed no *memory* budget: an allowlisted allocator
  (`zeros`/`fill`/`buffer`/`range`) could exhaust RAM in one capped-but-large call,
  or aggregate across a loop (each iteration's allocation never trips the
  back-edge counter), and the resulting out-of-memory went through `x_oom →
  abort()` — **uncatchable** by the sandbox's `g_has_error` path, so the host
  process died with SIGABRT (a generated `zeros of [99999, 99999]` was enough).
  Added a per-run byte budget: the size-controlled allocators call
  `sandbox_charge()` before allocating, and a charge that would exceed the budget
  raises a *caught* error so `sandbox_run` returns `{ok:0}` instead of aborting.
  The budget is cumulative over the run (so the aggregate-in-a-loop vector is
  bounded too) and configurable via a new optional `max_bytes` arg
  (`sandbox_run of [descriptor, max_iterations?, max_bytes?]`, default 256 MiB).
  Also gave `zeros` the same per-call size cap `fill`/`buffer` already had (it was
  uncapped, so it could `abort()` even outside a sandbox). Regression: section
  [108] (`test_sandbox_budget`), including the cumulative case. The in-process
  budget covers the array/tensor allocation vectors; a fork+`setrlimit` jail would
  cover every byte but would have to serialize the result Value across the pipe
  (breaking the `{ok, result}` contract existing callers read) and can't safely
  fork a pthreads process — out of scope here.
- **Meta-interpreter parity with the C evaluator (#306).** `lib/eigen.eigs`
  advertised "full parity" but `eigen_eval` diverged from the C VM: `and`/`or`
  returned `0`/`1` instead of the deciding operand (so `1 and 2`→`1` not `2`,
  `0 or 3`→`1` not `3`, breaking the `x is config or fallback` idiom), and an
  unbound identifier silently returned `null` instead of raising. Fixed: `and`/
  `or` now do value-returning short-circuit using the host VM's own truthiness
  (exact falsy-set parity: `0`, `""`, `null`, empty list/dict), and an unbound
  name raises via a new `_env_has` existence check (distinct from a name bound
  to `null`, which still returns `null`). The divide/modulo-by-zero *value* was
  already at parity (`0`); the C VM's stderr `Warning ... division by zero` can't
  be emitted (EigenScript has no stderr-write builtin) and error messages carry
  no `line N` prefix (eval-time AST nodes don't track lines) — both now
  documented in the header instead of over-claimed. ouroboros is unaffected (it
  vendors only the front-end, not `eigen_eval`). Regression: section [107]
  (`test_meta_parity`). Surfaced a separate, pre-existing host bug — a `throw`
  inside a function body doesn't halt the caller's subsequent statements — which
  is tracked on its own, not in this fix.
- **Cycle collector now reclaims local pure-value cycles (#307).** A list/dict
  that referenced itself (or a peer that pointed back) and was built inside a
  function then dropped was reclaimed by *nothing*: the runtime collector built
  its universe only from the captured-env registry (closure cycles), and the
  exit collector only from a global-scope snapshot — so a purely-local value
  cycle leaked, unbounded, for the life of the process (ASan: a 50k-iteration
  self-ref-list loop leaked 6.8 MB / 100k objects; mutual dicts, 26 MB). Most
  damaging for long-running consumers (graph/tree structures with back-edges)
  and the freestanding/EigenOS target, where there is no process exit to mop up.
  Fix: a Bacon-Rajan "possible root" hook (`gc_note_possible_root`) — when a
  LIST/DICT loses a ref but stays alive, it is parked (with one pin) on a
  per-state value-candidate buffer; `gc_collect_cycles` feeds that buffer into
  the existing mark-sweep as pinned seeds (the pin is accounted exactly like the
  exit snapshot's, so a cycle held only by its pin + internal edges still counts
  as garbage), then drains the pins. Hooked into both `val_decref` and
  `slot_decref` (the env-slot drop is the dominant path by which a function-local
  cycle dies), gated like the env registry (off when GC-disabled, mid-collection,
  or multithreaded — kept off the lock-free hot decref). No semantics change; the
  collector's edge-accounting and the strictly-leak-clean closure-cycle gate
  ([87]) are untouched. Regression: section [106] (`test_value_cycles` — self-,
  mutual-, and back-edge value cycles reclaimed; a live globally-rooted cycle
  survives the churn), strict leak-gated like [87]. ~1–2% on a container-heavy
  bench (within box noise; the decref-to-zero path is unchanged).

## [0.22.0] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- **Data races: parallel workers executing the same shared chunk (#297).**
  ThreadSanitizer flagged ~22 races when concurrent `spawn`'d workers ran the
  same chunks: the refcount-mode gate (`g_vm_multithreaded`) was re-written on
  *every* spawn, racing already-running workers reading it in
  `env_incref`/`chunk_incref` (the correctness-critical ones — a lost flag read
  could take the non-atomic refcount path → UAF); the per-chunk JIT hotness
  counters (`exec_count`/`back_edge_count`) and OSR machinery; the env/dict
  inline caches (a torn write risks a wrong cache hit when two threads share an
  env); the lazy name-hash cache (`const_hashes[idx]`); and `g_trace_current_line`.
  Fixes: write the multithreaded flag only on the 0→1 transition (it's published
  to all workers via the first write's happens-before); gate the JIT counters,
  OSR, inline-cache *writes*, and the trace-line store off under MT (JIT compile
  is already MT-gated by #296; the IC fast-path *read* stays — it just misses for
  a worker's env); and precompute the name hash at compile time instead of
  lazily at runtime (eager, idempotent, a tiny perf win). Single-threaded
  behavior is unchanged (every gate passes when not multithreaded). Result:
  ThreadSanitizer reports **0 data races** on a parallel-shared-closure workload
  (was ~22). Regression: section [102] (`test_spawn_parallel` — 12 concurrent
  workers, exact results). Suites 2340/2340, leak floor 0, jit-smoke green.
- **Threaded cycle-GC: env↔closure cycles created on worker threads now collected.**
  The cycle collector's candidate registry was per-thread and was emptied +
  disabled the moment `spawn` went multithreaded, so any env↔closure cycle
  created after the first spawn — on the main thread or a worker — was never a
  collection candidate and leaked at exit (e.g. `test_concurrent` leaked ~21 KB).
  Moved the registry to the EigsState (shared across the state's threads),
  guarded by a `gc_lock` taken only while multithreaded; registration now
  continues across threads, while collection still runs only single-threaded
  (it races mutators otherwise). `handle_table_drain` clears `multithreaded`
  after joining every worker, so the exit-time `gc_collect_at_exit` sweeps the
  whole accumulated registry — reclaiming both main-thread and (since-joined)
  worker-thread cycles. Verified race-free with ThreadSanitizer (no races on the
  registry; the lock synchronizes concurrent register/unregister); the cycle
  collector's strict-clean section [87] still passes. Regression: section [101]
  (`test_spawn_gc`, leak-gated). Prerequisite was #296 (the apparent "GC change
  crashes" was actually the worker-JIT UAF). NOTE: parallel workers executing the
  *same* shared chunk still race on per-chunk advisory state (exec_count, JIT
  hotness counters, inline caches, shared-env refcounts) — pre-existing, separate
  from this change; tracked separately.
- **SEGV: shared chunk JIT-compiled on a worker thread (#296).** A function that
  got hot and JIT-compiled while running on a `spawn`'d worker left
  `chunk->jit_code` pointing into that worker's *per-thread* JIT code arena,
  which `jit_thread_destroy` munmaps at thread detach. `chunk->jit_code` is a
  single pointer on the *shared* chunk, so the next caller jumped into freed
  executable memory → SEGV (reliably at scale, e.g. a worker that calls a shared
  helper in a loop, repeated across ~50+ workers; pre-existing, layout-sensitive
  UAF). Fixed by gating JIT compilation off while multithreaded
  (`jit_try_compile_chunk` / `_osr` no-op under MT, leaving `jit_state` at 0 so
  compilation resumes once single-threaded) — matching the existing "disable
  while MT" policy for the cycle collector and call-env parking. Code main
  compiled outside the MT window lives in main's arena (alive until exit) and is
  safe to run from a worker. Regression: suite section [100] (`test_spawn_jit`,
  leak-clean, reproduces the SEGV with the gate removed).
- **Spawn/channel memory leaks at exit — ASan "tolerated leak" floor 4 → 0.**
  Two fixes, both most relevant to the freestanding/EigenOS target where there
  is no process exit to reclaim resources:
  - *Handle-table resources never reclaimed.* Channels (`channel of …`) and
    spawned-thread handles live in the process handle table keyed by an integer
    id, not on a refcounted Value, so the GC never freed them — `close_channel`
    only flips a flag, and an unjoined worker left its `ThreadHandle` behind.
    Added `handle_table_drain`, run once the program finishes (value world still
    alive): joins any still-registered worker (`spawn` uses a joinable pthread;
    `thread_join` already frees joined ones, so no double-join), then frees every
    remaining channel (drains+decrefs buffered messages, destroys the mutex/conds,
    frees the struct).
  - *Worker return value over-incref'd.* `thread_entry` did `val_incref` on the
    result, but `vm_execute` already returns an owned ref that the handle takes
    over — a second ref with no owner that leaked the worker's return value
    (masked when the return happened to be arena-allocated). Removed.
  Together these clear every `rc_ok`-gated spawn/channel test. One residual
  remains and is *not* in the tally: `test_concurrent` leaks ~21 KB of
  main-thread env↔closure cycles created after the first `spawn` —
  `env_mark_captured` skips GC registration while multithreaded (cross-thread
  registry hazard), so they're never collection candidates; its [55] suite block
  is marker-only so doesn't gate on it. Reclaiming it needs a thread-safe GC
  registry (threading hardening). A spawn+join loop does *not* accumulate
  (verified to N=400).

### Added
- **`report_value of x` — a value-signal observer channel (#294).** The
  windowed observer predicates (`report`/`converged`/`stable`/`oscillating`)
  classify the trajectory of `entropy(value)`, not the value itself. Because
  entropy is a non-monotonic projection of `|x|` (flat in mid-magnitude
  regions), a sustained *value* oscillation there reads as `stable` — the
  observer faithfully measures entropy-settling, which is a lossy proxy for
  value-settling. Proven against a closed-form oracle `x = 5 + 0.6·cos(k·ω)`
  (oscillates forever): `report of x` says `stable` in the flat-entropy
  plateau, while the new `report_value of x` says `moving`/`oscillating`
  uniformly — never falsely `converged`. The new form runs the *same* windowed
  logic and thresholds on the value's relative step `Δv/(1+|x|)` (relative, so
  bands carry the same meaning across value scales); vocabulary
  `oscillating`/`converged`/`stable`/`moving`/`equilibrium`. Purely additive: a
  parallel per-slot value window beside the entropy window, two new appended
  opcodes (`OP_REPORT_VALUE_SLOT`/`_NAME`), and a compile-time intercept
  paralleling `report`. Existing entropy predicates are unchanged. See
  docs/OBSERVER.md ("Two signals").

## [0.21.2] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- **Cross-thread channel transfer corrupted dict string keys (#293).** Values
  sent on a channel were shared by reference (incref'd, not copied). A dict's
  string keys are interned in the *creating thread's* per-thread intern table,
  which is freed when that thread detaches — so a dict built in a worker, sent
  over a channel, and read after the worker exited had dangling (garbage) keys
  (`msg.k` read null; surfaced by EigenGauntlet's `concurrent` lab as
  `cannot apply '+' to num and null`). `send` now deep-copies the value
  (`val_clone_for_send`), re-homing dict keys into a process-global, deduped,
  lock-protected intern table that lives for the process (reachable root → not
  a leak). String *values* were already owned and unaffected; fn/builtin/buffer
  are still shared by refcount. The copy also removes the old
  shared-mutable-container concurrency footgun for the copied types. Regression
  test: suite section [98] (cross-thread dict built in a spawned worker).

## [0.21.1] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- **JIT/OSR use-after-free on a re-entrant env realloc (#291).** A function
  whose `local_count` sat at the env capacity boundary would realloc
  `env->values` mid-body when the loop machinery bound its two implicit names
  (`__loop_iterations__`, `__loop_exit__`) — which `env_reserve_slots` did not
  account for. That realloc freed the array the JIT's `%r12` (`fn_env->values`)
  cache pointed at; a re-entrant `vm_execute` (`sandbox_run`/`vm_run_bytecode`)
  then reused the freed memory, so the next inline `GET_LOCAL` read garbage and
  threw `cannot index num` (intermittently, JIT-only). Surfaced by iLambdaAi's
  `grade()` ladder running its OSR-hot `ids_to_text` decoder interleaved with
  `sandbox_run`. Fix: `env_reserve_slots` now reserves `ENV_LOOP_BIND_HEADROOM`
  (2) extra *capacity* for the implicit loop bindings, so a call-time-reserved
  env never reallocs mid-body. Full suite + ASan leak-tally unchanged.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-06-28

### Security
- **`sandbox_run` is now fail-closed (allowlist).** The sandbox previously
  shadowed a hand-maintained *blocklist* (`SANDBOX_DENY`) — fail-open, so every
  builtin was reachable unless someone remembered to deny it. Builtins nobody
  had flagged leaked: `set_observer_thresholds` let sandboxed code rewrite the
  **process-global** observer thresholds (corrupting observer behavior for the
  whole host — including iLambdaAi's own `grade()` — after the run returned);
  the `screen_*` terminal ops, channel ops, and `exit` (which would kill the
  host) were also reachable. Replaced with a pure-compute **allowlist**
  (`SANDBOX_ALLOW`): the sandbox env shadows every global name not on the list,
  so a new builtin is denied by default and a gap costs only functionality,
  never host safety. The http_/db_/model_ extension surface is now auto-denied
  without enumeration.
- **HTTP aggregate request-body DoS.** The HTTP server bounded each request
  body (`EIGS_HTTP_MAX_BODY`, 16 MiB) and concurrent connections
  (`HTTP_MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNS`, 256) independently, but their *product*
  (~4 GiB held at once) was unbounded against host memory — a flood of
  concurrent max-size uploads could OOM the host even though no single request
  or connection misbehaved. Added a global in-flight body-byte budget
  (`EIGS_HTTP_MAX_BODY_TOTAL`, default 128 MiB): a connection whose buffer
  growth would push the aggregate past the budget is shed with `503`. Charged
  during the read loop and released on every connection exit path.
- **`sandbox_run` could be hung by a blocking builtin.** The iteration cap
  (`g_sandbox_loop_max`) bounds loop back-edges, not time spent inside one
  builtin, so a blocking builtin missing from the deny list hung the host
  indefinitely (e.g. `usleep of 30000000`, or `recv` on a channel that — spawn
  being denied — can never receive). `usleep`, `raw_key`, `recv`, `try_recv`,
  `recv_timeout`, and `send` are now shadowed by the blocked stub in a sandbox
  run, matching the file/process/network/db/thread builtins already denied. This
  matters most for the untrusted, *generated* code `sandbox_run` exists to grade.

### Fixed
- **Observer state drift across parked call-env reuse.** `vm_park_call_env`
  recycles a function's call env in place (the per-chunk `env_cache` fast path),
  but only reset the value slots — it left `Env::obs` (per-slot entropy/dH)
  intact. Observer state is part of binding identity (the #262 Phase-1 invariant
  resets it "on both park and free"; `env_free` honored it, this newer fast-park
  path silently did not), so a windowed predicate (`converged`/`stable`/…) on an
  observed **local** read the *previous* invocation's trajectory — a function
  with fewer than the window's worth of observed assignments would falsely
  "converge" on its second call. Now resets observer state on park. Caught only
  by an observer-output differential (park-on vs park-off).

### Restored
- **`exit` builtin** — `exit of N` performs a clean, uncatchable process exit
  with code N, unwinding to main's teardown via `g_has_error` (leak-clean even
  with live closures) rather than a raw `exit()`. Dropped in 0.19.0; consumers
  (tidelog/liferaft) use it on failure paths.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Named observer predicates: `<predicate> of <var>`.** Each of the six
  predicates (`converged`, `stable`, `improving`, `oscillating`, `diverging`,
  `equilibrium`) now accepts a named operand — `converged of x` — that
  classifies *that binding's* slot trajectory, parallel to `report of x`. The
  bare form (`converged`) is unchanged: it reads the **last-observed** binding
  in scope, which a trailing assignment silently repoints (every assignment is
  observed) — e.g. a `loop while not converged` whose body increments a counter
  after the iterate halts on the counter, not the iterate (this is why
  `dynamics`' `settle_steps` returned the same step count for every rate). The
  named form removes the ambiguity, and a named-predicate loop condition
  (`loop while not (converged of x)`) is self-terminating — it reads x's slot
  each iteration and does not arm the global-alias auto-stall the bare form
  opts into. Prefer the named form whenever more than one binding is observed
  in scope. Adds opcodes `OP_PREDICATE_SLOT` / `OP_PREDICATE_NAME` (appended at
  the end of the enum). See docs/PREDICATES.md.
- **Linter warning `W014`** flags a bare predicate in a loop condition whose
  body assigns more than one binding (where the last-observed binding — and so
  which one the predicate reads — is order-dependent). The named form
  `<predicate> of <var>` silences it; a single-observe loop body is not flagged.

### Performance

- **`for`-loops now reuse one loop env instead of allocating a fresh one per
  iteration.** A `for` that still needs a per-iteration env (notably every
  module-scope loop, where the loop var and loop-locals must not leak) used to
  `env_new`/`env_decref` every pass, which also thrashed the name-resolution
  inline cache for outer variables read in the body. The env is now created
  once and reused, in three tiers gated entirely at compile time:
  loops whose body defines a closure keep the old fresh-per-iteration behavior
  (the closure captures the env, so it can't be reused); loops with a
  loop-local or shadow persist the env and `LOOP_ENV_CLEAR` it each iteration
  (saving the allocation); and loops that provably create no loop-local
  (every assignment is an outer mutation) persist *and overwrite* the loop var
  in place with no clear, so `binding_version` stays stable and the outer-var
  inline cache stays hot. On a 2M-iteration accumulator this is ~30–36% faster
  (observed and unobserved alike); semantics are unchanged — the overwrite
  tier's loop-local proof is conservative and any uncertainty falls back to
  clear, then to fresh. Adds opcode `OP_LOOP_ENV_CLEAR` (appended at the end of
  the enum; `LOOP_ENV_CLEAR` also resets the env's slot-keyed observer state so
  an observed loop-local matches fresh-env `report`/predicate behavior).

### Fixed

- **Memory-unsafe crashers on adversarial input (security).** A re-review of the
  runtime closed ten reachable crashes and a leak, all triggerable from pure
  EigenScript or hand-assembled bytecode: parser C-stack overflow on deeply
  nested prefix (`not`/`-`/`~`) and right-recursive `of` expressions and on long
  iterative postfix/binop chains (`a[0][0]…`, `1+1+…`) that bypassed the
  parse-depth guard and overflowed the recursive compiler; integer-overflow
  heap corruption in `str_replace`, `buf_copy`, `matmul` (incl. the flat-buffer
  fast path) and a `substr` over-allocation; the `sandbox_run` / `vm_run_bytecode`
  bytecode bridge, which trusted operand indices — a hand-built descriptor with
  an out-of-range constant / function / jump operand, a name operand pointing at
  a non-string constant, or an `OP_DICT` count larger than the live stack drove
  an out-of-bounds read past the name deny-list and loop cap (now a one-pass
  bytecode verifier rejects such a chunk before it runs); an un-encodable
  (>64 KB) jump/loop offset that silently left a wild jump; and a JIT `and`/`or`
  per-iteration reference leak (the PEEK ops were wrongly marked as pushing an
  immediate, so the fall-through `OP_POP` skipped the decref of a heap left
  operand once OSR-compiled). Malformed source and untrusted assembled bytecode
  no longer crash. (PRs #277, #278.)
- **Temporal queries were wrong under the JIT/OSR.** The JIT's `OP_LINE` updated
  `g_vm.current_line` but not `g_trace_current_line` (the line the history tape
  records), so once a loop OSR-compiled, every `what/when/where/why/how is x at
  <line>`, `state_at`, and named interrogative read the line frozen at the point
  the thunk took over — e.g. `4999` instead of `19999` in a 20000-iteration
  loop. The interpreter and `prev of` were unaffected. The OP_LINE arm now
  stamps both, mirroring the interpreter. (PR #279.)
- **HTTP routes ignored a request's query string for route identity.** The
  request target was parsed whole into `path` (`ext_http.c`), so a route
  registered as `/ping` returned 404 for `/ping?x=1` — both exact route
  matching (`strcmp(r->path, path)`) and static-file serving compared against
  the raw target including `?...`. The query string is request data, not part
  of the route, so the target is now split at the first `?` before route and
  static matching. The original request line stays intact in
  `http_request_headers` (raw `reqbuf`), so scripts can still read the query
  via `lib/http.eigs`'s `parse_query`. Covered by `test_http_server.sh` HS01b
  (route + query) and HS05b (static file + query).
- **LSP rename is now scope-correct, including EigenScript's subtler rules.**
  Rename resolves each occurrence to a binding identity — the innermost
  enclosing function that binds the name as a parameter or `local`, else the
  global — and only renames occurrences sharing the cursor's binding. This
  covers (a) explicit parameter shadowing, (b) the **implicit `n`** parameter
  of a no-arg `define` (a real whole-body binding, so a body `n` is not the
  global `n`; issue #241), (c) **order-sensitive `local`** — a `local x` binds
  only from its declaration onward, so a read *before* it resolves to the outer
  binding, and (d) **`for`-loop scopes** — a statement `for` introduces a scope
  for its loop variable and any `local` inside it (neither leaks out;
  SS5E/SS5F/SS8) — but a `for`'s **iterable expression** (between `in` and the
  body) is evaluated in the outer scope, so in `for i in i:` the second `i` is
  the outer binding, not the loop variable. A **default-parameter expression**
  (`define f(b is a)`) is likewise evaluated in the outer scope — only the name
  before each `is` is a parameter, so the default's identifiers resolve to
  their real binding (an outer var, or an earlier param if named). `if`, `loop
  while`, and comprehensions are transparent (their loop-vars/locals touch the
  surrounding scope, matching the runtime). Positions still come from exact
  token spans.
  Verified by applying the WorkspaceEdit and asserting the resulting source for
  each rule.
- **LSP rename could corrupt source.** Reference positions came from AST node
  columns, but identifier (`AST_IDENT`) nodes were built with `make_node`,
  which zero-fills `col` — so every rename edit landed at column 0. Renaming
  `count` returned edits at `[line,0]`, missing the real occurrences and
  overwriting the start of unrelated lines (e.g. replacing `print`). Fixed at
  the root: the five `AST_IDENT` sites now carry the identifier token's real
  line/col. Rename itself was additionally rewritten to take every edit
  position from the **token stream** (always-exact spans), skipping
  dot-member accesses (`obj.name`) — so it can no longer mis-place an edit
  regardless of AST-node quirks. This also fixed function rename (its
  definition came from a symbol with a stale position) and parameter rename.
- **`find_token_at` let an adjacent token steal the cursor position.** Its
  hit-test used `col < t->col + len + 1` (a one-column slop), so `(` at the
  column before a parameter claimed the parameter's column — rename/hover from
  a signature returned the wrong token (or nothing). Now uses strict
  containment `[col, col+len)` with a closest-token fallback.
- **LSP leaked an AST on every document change.** `doc_analyze` set
  `doc->ast = NULL` without freeing the prior parse; a long editing session
  leaked one AST per `didChange`. Now frees it (and on `didClose`). AST nodes
  own their strings, so this is safe after the token list is freed.
- **Assignment statements were tagged with the *next* line.** The parser
  built an `AST_ASSIGN` node for `name is expr` after consuming the
  statement's trailing newline, so it took the following line's number —
  offsetting every assignment by one for the linter, LSP go-to-definition,
  document symbols, and diagnostics. Now taken from the name token. Surfaced
  by wiring lint diagnostics into the LSP (the squiggle landed a line low).

### Added

- **LSP: semantic tokens**, plus a `len` (source-span) field on every token.
  `textDocument/semanticTokens/full` classifies the token stream — keywords,
  numbers, strings, and (the part a TextMate grammar can't do) identifiers as
  function / variable / parameter / namespace via the symbol table — and emits
  the LSP delta-encoded array. The new `Token.len` (set in the lexer, exact for
  every lexeme) also replaces `find_token_at`'s old "number length ≈ 4" guess,
  tightening hover/definition hit-testing.
- **LSP: lint diagnostics + code actions.** With a document that parses, the
  server now runs the linter and publishes each warning as a coded diagnostic
  (severity 2, `code` = the #3 W-series), so the editor shows the same issues
  as `--lint` — not just the first parse error (which now also carries
  `code: E002`). `textDocument/codeAction` offers a quickfix for `W001`
  (remove the unused-variable line); the handler recomputes diagnostics from
  the AST and is structured to take more code→fix mappings. `lint.c` grew a
  reusable `lint_collect(ast, …)` core (no I/O) shared by `--lint` and the LSP.
- **LSP: document symbols, workspace symbols, formatting, and rename.** The
  language server (`src/eigenlsp`) now advertises and handles
  `textDocument/documentSymbol` (outline of functions, imports, and top-level
  variables), `workspace/symbol` (case-insensitive filter across open
  documents), `textDocument/formatting` (a whole-document edit produced by the
  CLI formatter — `fmt.c` grew a reusable `format_source_string` string→string
  core shared by `--fmt` and the LSP), and `textDocument/rename` (a
  WorkspaceEdit over every reference plus the definition; refuses to rename
  builtins/keywords). Builds on the existing symbol table and reference walker.
  `tests/test_lsp.py` +13 behavioral checks. (Semantic tokens and code actions
  remain — the former needs per-token source spans in the lexer, the latter is
  best wired to the linter's coded diagnostics.)
- **First-class test runner — `eigenscript --test [paths...]`.** Discovers
  `test_*.eigs` files (in `./tests` by default, or in given dirs/files) and
  runs each in its **own interpreter process**, so the `lib/test.eigs`
  assertion counters never bleed between files. A file passes iff it exits 0
  (the `test_summary` convention, which `assert`s on failure); the runner
  parses each file's `Tests: N | Pass: P | Fail: F` line to aggregate
  assertion counts, prints a per-file PASS/FAIL summary (showing a failing
  file's captured output), and exits nonzero if any file failed. `--json`
  emits a machine-readable result object for CI. The runner itself is written
  in EigenScript (`lib/test_runner.eigs`), dispatched like `--pkg`.
- **`exe_path of null` builtin** — returns the absolute path of the running
  interpreter binary (via `/proc/self/exe`, with an `argv[0]` fallback). Lets
  a script re-invoke the same interpreter without assuming `eigenscript` is on
  `PATH`; the test runner uses it to launch each test file. Surfaced by
  building `--test` — an EigenScript program previously had no way to find its
  own interpreter.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Flat-buffer tensors (shaped `VAL_BUFFER`)** — a buffer now carries an
  optional 2-D shape: `buffer of [rows, cols]` makes a flat `double[rows*cols]`
  with that shape, and `reshape of [buf, rows, cols]` shapes an existing flat
  buffer (element count must match). `shape of <buffer>` returns `[rows, cols]`
  (or `[count]` when unshaped). The tensor builtins `matmul`/`add`/`relu` gain a
  shaped-buffer fast path that computes directly on the flat `double[]` — no
  per-call flatten/rebuild of nested lists — using the **same** kernels
  (`ne_matmul_buf` i-k-j accumulation, `num_guard` elementwise), so results are
  **byte-identical** to the nested-list tensor path. This eliminates the dominant
  cost of nested-list neural inference (re-flattening constant weights every
  call): a 3-layer MLP forward (433→64→32→6) is **~11× faster** with shaped-buffer
  weights, the forward source unchanged. 1-D buffers (`rows==0`) are treated as
  row vectors, so `matmul of [vec, mat]` yields a 1-D result. Back-compatible:
  `buffer of N` and flat `b[k]` indexing are unchanged (shape is metadata read
  only by the tensor ops).

- **`norm` reduction builtin** — `norm of a` returns the L2 (Euclidean) norm
  `sqrt(sum_i a[i]*a[i])` of a buffer or tensor. Like `sum`/`dot` its summation
  association is unspecified (opt-in SIMD reassociation); no-NaN/Inf preserved.

### Fixed

- **`sum` now works on buffers** — `sum of <buffer>` previously returned 0 (the
  tensor flatten path only walked lists, silently skipping the `VAL_BUFFER`
  numeric fast-path type). It now sums buffer elements directly. `sum`/`norm`
  also apply `num_guard` per step (no-NaN/Inf invariant), and their summation
  association is now documented as unspecified (see docs/SPEC.md "Reductions").

### Added

- **`dot` reduction builtin** — `dot of [a, b]` returns the sum over `i` of
  `a[i] * b[i]` for two numeric buffers (length = the shorter of the two).
  Its summation **association is unspecified by spec**: callers must not depend
  on the exact low-bit rounding. This is a deliberate opt-in that licenses an
  optimizing backend (the AOT native compiler) to reassociate the sum across
  SIMD lanes — a speedup a strict left-to-right `loop while` accumulation
  forbids, because FP addition is non-associative. The no-NaN/no-Inf invariant
  still holds (`num_guard` at each step). See docs/SPEC.md "Reductions".

## [0.18.0] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Streaming audio file playback (`audio_music_*`)** in the graphics
  extension (`src/ext_gfx.c`), so a program can play a real music file
  instead of only synthesized PCM samples. `audio_music_play of [path, loops]`
  streams an mp3/ogg/wav via SDL_mixer (`loops` -1 = forever); `audio_music_volume
  of v` (0–128) and `audio_music_stop of null` control it. Music plays on its
  own audio device alongside the existing SFX sample queue (two SDL audio
  devices coexist; the OS mixes them), so SFX are unaffected. SDL_mixer (and
  its MP3 codec, libmpg123) is `dlopen`ed lazily — same pattern as SDL2 — so
  the gfx binary keeps no hard link dependency and the headless build is
  untouched. Surfaced by Tidepool needing background music (its audio was
  sample-queue only). Build with `make gfx`; requires `libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0` at
  runtime.

## [0.17.2] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **`spawn` now raises if the OS cannot create the thread** instead of
  silently returning a live-looking handle for a thread that never ran (#269).
  The
  `pthread_create` return value was ignored, so under memory pressure (where
  the new thread's stack allocation fails with `EAGAIN`/`ENOMEM`) the spawned
  function simply never executed — and any sibling that depended on it ran on:
  e.g. a thread meant to `close_channel` a channel another thread is waiting
  on never closes it, so the waiter blocks until its timeout, which for a
  large `recv_timeout` deadline is effectively forever. Surfaced as an
  intermittent hang of `tests/test_channel_nb.eigs` under the ASan suite on a
  4 GB host (ASan's overhead exhausted committable memory at thread-stack
  allocation). `spawn` now cleans up the unstarted handle and raises
  `spawn: could not create thread: <reason>`, turning a far-away hang into an
  immediate, clear error at the spawn point.
- **JIT/OSR: an on-stack-replacement thunk no longer over-reaches past its
  own loop's back-edge into enclosing-loop code** (#267). An OSR thunk is
  invoked at a hot loop header with the live stack pointer to accelerate that
  loop body; the scanner, however, kept walking past the loop's own back-edge
  into the post-loop continuation. For an *inner* loop that continuation is
  the *enclosing* loop's body, compiled against the enclosing loop's stack
  frame — but the thunk had entered mid-nest at the inner header, so running
  that code natively read the wrong (reserved-null / stale) stack slots and
  corrupted execution. It surfaced only with the OSR threshold lowered
  (`EIGS_JIT_OSR_THRESHOLD=1`) on nested-loop, index-heavy programs (e.g. the
  dynamics lab's Gauss–Seidel solver) as a nondeterministic `cannot index
  num` (a null `INDEX_GET` target), `index must be an integer`, or double
  free; ASan was clean because the corruption stayed within the VM stack
  bounds. The OSR prefix scanner now stops right after a loop's own back-edge
  (`JUMP_BACK` whose target equals the OSR entry offset), confining each OSR
  thunk to its hot loop body — which is the correct OSR boundary anyway, so
  every nested loop now gets its own tight thunk instead of one over-reaching
  inner thunk. The from-zero compile (entry offset 0) is unchanged: it enters
  at the function start where the stack frame matches the compiler's tracking.

## [0.17.1] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- The prebuilt **Linux release binary is now built on Ubuntu 22.04** (glibc
  2.35) instead of `ubuntu-latest`. GitHub moved the `ubuntu-latest` runner
  from 22.04 to 24.04 (glibc 2.39), which raised the v0.17.0
  `eigenscript-linux-x86_64` binary's glibc floor to `GLIBC_2.38` — so it
  failed with `GLIBC_2.38 not found` on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (a current,
  widely-deployed LTS). Building on 22.04 keeps the floor at glibc 2.35, so the
  binary runs on 22.04 and every newer distro. Homebrew and source builds were
  never affected (they compile against the local libc).

## [0.17.0] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- Stdlib gap-fill across `lib/list.eigs`, `lib/string.eigs`, and
  `lib/math.eigs` — all pure EigenScript, no C:
  - `list`: `any`/`all` (short-circuit predicate checks), `find_index`
    (first index where a predicate holds, `-1` if none), `partition`
    (`[passing, failing]` in one pass), `group_by` (bucket into a dict by a
    stringified key), `deep_flatten` (full recursive flatten),
    `count_of`/`frequencies` (occurrence count / full distribution dict).
  - `string`: `capitalize` (uppercase the first character),
    `replace_all` (replace every occurrence; non-overlapping, no
    re-replacement of inserted text; empty `find` returns the source
    unchanged).
  - `math`: `argmax`/`argmin` (index of the largest/smallest element,
    first index on ties, `-1` if empty).
  - Closes the stdlib good-first-issue set (#181, #192–#199).

### Changed

- **Observer state is now keyed to the variable binding, not the Value
  object** (#262). Each binding carries its own entropy/dH trajectory on a
  per-`(env, slot)` `ObserverSlot`, observed eagerly at assignment. The old
  model stored observer state on the recyclable, ref-shared `Value` object,
  so a convergence iterate built through temporaries that alias the variable
  (the normal solver shape — `cand is x*0.1; … ; x is cand`) never
  accumulated a trajectory and `report`/`converged` stalled at the
  partial-window `equilibrium` fallback even at rest. With slot-keying, such
  loops converge correctly. Numbers are now always immediate doubles — they
  never get heap-boxed to carry observer state — which also removes per-binding
  observer allocations from the hot path.
- Behavior delta at the edges: `report` / `observe` / bare `where`·`why`·`how`
  applied to a **non-binding** expression (a computed value or an unobserved
  parameter, which has no trajectory) now return the no-observation defaults
  (`"equilibrium"` / `[…,0,0,0]` / `0`). The same interrogatives on a bound
  name are unchanged — they read the binding's slot.

### Removed

- The `EIGS_OBS_SHADOW` value-path escape hatch and the entire value-path
  observer machinery (the per-`Value` observer fields, the `TAG_TRACKED` slot
  tag, `make_tracked_num`) — the slot model is the only observer model (#262).

### Fixed

- `record_history` now raises on a non-numeric flag instead of silently
  coercing it to `0` (disable). Previously `record_history of null` (or a
  string) turned per-assignment history recording **off** — the opposite of
  the function's purpose — which then made `prev of x` and the `at`-temporal
  queries return `null` with no error, hard to trace back to the call. It also
  overrode the auto-enable the compiler performs for a temporal query. Now a
  non-number flag errors, matching the strict-input direction of #245/#246.
  (#255, found by the `dynamics` consumer as F-DYN-1.)

## [0.16.3] — 2026-06-19

Makes observer-based loop-halting opt-in. An observed `loop while` no longer
auto-halts on the global observer's convergence unless its condition is itself
observer-based (references a predicate) — so plain loops can't be silently
truncated by cross-talk from what their body, or a callee, happened to assign.
Fixes undocumented behavior; the `loop while not converged` idiom is unchanged.

### Changed — observer loop-halting is now opt-in (compositional)

- An observed `loop while` was auto-halted when the **global** last-observer
  showed convergence for ~100 iterations — for **every** `loop while`, including
  plain counting loops that never mention a predicate. Because the watched
  observer is global, a loop's termination could be changed by what its body, or
  a function it called, happened to assign — non-local cross-talk that silently
  truncated loops with no error. (Surfaced by the liferaft DST: a bounded
  `loop while step < 1000` halted at step 146; the sim's outcome depended on
  incidental surrounding assignments.)
- Now the convergence-halt is **opt-in**: it applies only when the loop
  **condition is observer-based** (references a predicate — `loop while not
  converged`, etc.). A plain loop runs until its own condition is false. Both
  keep the absolute iteration cap (the runaway-loop guard). The compiler
  classifies the condition once and emits `OP_LOOP_STALL_CHECK` (observer-based)
  or the new `OP_LOOP_CAP_CHECK` (plain); both the interpreter and the JIT key
  off that compile-time opcode, so they can never disagree on the
  classification.
- `loop while not converged` and the existing halting tests are unchanged.
  Behavior change only for plain `loop while` loops that were being silently
  halted by observer cross-talk — those now run to completion.
- Tests: `tests/test_loop_halting.sh` pins the classifier at the boundary
  (predicate under `not`/`and`/`or` → observer-based; plain comparisons →
  plain) and checks the interpreter and JIT agree. `docs/SPEC.md` updated.

## [0.16.2] — 2026-06-19

A correctness patch. `load_file` no longer silently swallows parse errors — it
raises them like `eval`/`import` do — and the two latent stdlib bugs that
change immediately exposed (a function that never loaded, a variable that never
took effect) are fixed, with a guard so the whole class stays visible. No
behavior change for any file that already parsed cleanly.

### Fixed — `load_file` now surfaces parse errors instead of silently running a partial AST

- `load_file` parsed the target file but never checked `g_parse_errors`, so a
  file the parser couldn't fully accept was compiled and executed as a partial
  (incorrect) AST with **no error** — a statement the parser rejected would
  silently do nothing. Direct execution aborts on a parse error; `import` and
  `eval` already raise; `load_file` was the one path that swallowed it. It now
  raises a catchable runtime error (`load_file: parse error in '<path>'`),
  matching `eval`/`import`. Found by the liferaft DST: an expression-rooted
  lvalue (`(call).field is x`) — which direct execution rejects — was silently
  accepted inside a `load_file`'d module, dropping the assignment.
- Regression: `tests/test_import_errors.eigs` (a `load_file` of a file with an
  expression-rooted-lvalue parse error raises and is catchable; a clean
  `load_file` still executes normally). No change for any file that parses
  cleanly (the entire stdlib and suite are unaffected).
- Two silent `g_parse_errors++` sites in `parser.c` (unexpected token in
  expression; statement that made no progress) now print
  `Parse error line N: ...` with the token, like `p_expect` — the class was
  hard to diagnose because these incremented the count with no message.

### Fixed — stdlib `when` combinator never loaded; renamed to `apply_when`

- With parse errors now visible, a sweep of the stdlib found
  `lib/functional.eigs` defined a function named `when` — a reserved
  interrogative keyword — so `define when(...)` never parsed. The `when`
  combinator was documented in `docs/STDLIB.md` but callable nowhere (its
  parse error was swallowed at `load_file` time). Renamed to **`apply_when`**;
  `docs/STDLIB.md` updated. Sibling of `lib/lab.eigs`'s `stable` (a variable
  shadowing the `stable` predicate keyword), fixed the same way. Both are
  behavior-restoring: the helpers work for the first time.
- Guard: `tests/run_all_tests.sh` now parse-checks every `lib/*.eigs` (via
  `--lint`, which parses without executing), so any identifier shadowing a
  reserved keyword — or any other stdlib parse error — fails the suite loudly
  instead of being silently swallowed.

## [0.16.1] — 2026-06-19

A correctness-and-robustness patch on top of 0.16.0. It closes a remote,
unauthenticated HTTP denial-of-service (a `Content-Length` SEGV), drives the
ASan leak tally from 10 down to 4 (the spawn-thread floor) across the runtime,
HTTP, and `store` extensions, recovers the JIT/OSR acceleration that the #211
leak fix had to give up (~34% on observed-assign hot loops), and hardens the
build against the implicit-declaration pointer-truncation class that caused the
DoS. No language-surface behavior changes versus 0.16.0.

### Docs — the implicit `n` parameter shadows an outer `n` (#241)

- A `define` with no parameter list gets one implicit parameter named `n`
  (existing, documented behavior — `define double as: return n * 2`). #241
  reported `n is expr` inside such a function failing to update an outer `n`
  as a "name-dependent scope bug." It is not a bug: `n` is a bound parameter,
  and parameters shadow outer bindings like any other name (`define g(x)` with
  an outer `x` shadows it identically; `define g()` ≡ `define g(n)`). `SPEC.md`
  now states this explicitly, with a runnable example; `test_scope_semantics`
  pins it (SS7A–SS7F). Documentation only — no behavior change.

### Fixed — `lib/lab.eigs` leaked experiment store handles (#233)

- `lab` functions assigned internal variables without `local`. Per the
  documented scope rule (`name is expr` updates an enclosing binding of the
  same name if one exists), `load`'s internal `exp`/`vals` **clobbered a
  caller's same-named variables** — repointing the caller's experiment at
  `load`'s store handle and orphaning the original, which then leaked
  (uncloseable). `load` now declares all its internals `local`. Added a
  `close_experiment(exp)` helper; `test_lab` closes both experiments.
- Clears `test_lab` under ASan; harness leak tally **5 → 4**. The remaining
  4 are all spawn-thread programs (cycle collector off once multithreaded) —
  the floor without a threaded GC.
- (Surfaced a separate VM bug while diagnosing: scope resolution is
  name-dependent — `n` uniquely ignores the update-outer rule. Tracked as
  #241.)

### Hardening — `-Werror=implicit-function-declaration`

- Added `-Werror=implicit-function-declaration` to the build flags (Makefile
  `CFLAGS` and `build.sh`). An implicitly-declared function is assumed to
  return `int`, so a pointer-returning function compiled without its prototype
  has its return truncated to 32 bits on 64-bit — a corrupted pointer that
  crashes at runtime, layout-dependently. That class just caused a remote DoS
  in the HTTP server (the `strcasestr`/`_GNU_SOURCE` SEGV) and slipped through
  CI as a mere warning. It's now a hard build error. The buildable surface is
  warning-clean, so this is a no-op today except as a regression gate.

### Fixed — HTTP server crash (SEGV) on any request with a Content-Length header

- **Security/robustness:** the server segfaulted on any request carrying a
  `Content-Length` header (a malformed `Content-Length: -1` was the repro) —
  a remote, unauthenticated denial-of-service. Root cause: `ext_http.c` used
  `strcasestr` (a GNU extension) without defining `_GNU_SOURCE`, so it was
  implicitly declared as returning `int`. On 64-bit, its `char*` result was
  truncated to 32 bits and sign-extended back, producing a corrupted pointer
  (`0xffffffff……`) that the subsequent `strtol` dereferenced. Fixed by
  defining `_GNU_SOURCE` before the includes so the real prototype is used.
- The body-length validation logic was already correct (rejects negative /
  oversized with 400) — it just never ran, because the corrupted pointer
  crashed first. With the prototype fixed, `Content-Length: -1` now returns
  400 and the server survives.
- `tests/test_http_server.sh` goes from 9/28 to **28/28**. Swept the full
  http build for other implicit declarations — none. (This was previously
  mistaken for env flakiness; it was a real crash. The default
  `run_all_tests.sh` skips the http suite when the binary lacks `http_route`,
  so it went unnoticed.)

### Fixed — per-request leaks in HTTP `code` routes (#236, ext_http.c)

- The `code`-route handler parsed the route source per request but never
  freed the resulting AST, never freed the parsed auth-source AST, and never
  released the `Value` returned by `vm_execute` for either — so a
  long-running server leaked the AST + chunk + result **on every request**
  (and twice on authed routes). `compile_ast` does not take ownership and
  `vm_execute` returns an owned ref; both route paths now `free_ast` and
  `val_decref` like every other call site (`main`, `load_file`, `eval`).
- Measured (release http, 2000 code-route requests): VmRSS growth **67 MB →
  1.5 MB** (≈33 KB/request → flat). Verified via RSS rather than the ASan
  suite because the blocking server has no clean-exit path and the http
  integration suite is environment-flaky on the dev box (CI runs it).

- A program with a **parse error** leaked its partial AST: `parse` returns a
  partial tree even on error, and the abort branches in `main` (top-level
  run) and the `vm_run` `import` handler (a module that fails to parse) freed
  the token list / source / env but not the AST. Both now `free_ast(ast)` on
  the error path, matching the success path and the #214 `eval` fix.
- Clears `test_import_errors` (and the previously-uncounted `examples/errors/*`
  + `/tmp` parse-error programs); harness leak tally **6 → 5**.

### Fixed — container-builtin reference leaks (builtins.c)

- Four builtins that build a fresh list/dict per element leaked it: the
  *inner* fields were appended with `list_append_owned`/`dict_set_owned`,
  but the *outer* append of the finished container used plain `list_append`
  (which increfs), so the builtin's own ref was never released. Affected:
  `scan_tokens`, `scan_int_tokens`, `tokenize_with_names`,
  `nearest_in_range_all` — each `list_append(out, row)` → `list_append_owned`.
- Clears `test_builtin_indirect` and `test_coverage_gaps` (and the
  marker-only `test_string_math`); harness leak tally **8 → 6**.

### Fixed — reference leaks in the `store` extension (ext_store.c)

- **JSON parser** (`store_json_parse_object`/`_array`): every parsed object
  key leaked a `VAL_STR` (the `key` Value was allocated only to read
  `key->data.str`, then never freed), and parsed values were `dict_set`/
  `list_append`'d (which incref) without releasing the parser's own ref.
  Fixed via `dict_set_owned`/`list_append_owned` + freeing the key carrier;
  error paths now free the partial dict/list/key too.
- **Catalog lifecycle:** `store_close` (and the open error paths) called
  `free(store)` without `val_decref`-ing `store->catalog`, leaking the whole
  parsed catalog dict per store. Centralized in a new `store_free` helper;
  the catalog-rewrite path now drops the old catalog before replacing it.
- **Write path:** `store_put` increfs a new collection's `col_info` into the
  catalog without adopting; `store_update` built arg-lists for internal
  `store_delete`/`store_put` calls and ignored their return values, freeing
  none. All now balanced.
- Clears `test_store` and `test_handle_forge` under ASan; harness leak tally
  **10 → 8**. (`test_lab` still leaks — a separate `lib/lab.eigs`
  store-not-closed lifecycle bug, tracked as a follow-up.)

### Fixed — per-iteration leak in OSR-compiled observed-assign loops, and recovered their JIT coverage (#211, #231)

- **A hot loop that reassigns an *observed* variable in its body
  (`loop while improving: x is refine(x)`, `genetic_optimize`, etc.) leaked
  one `Value` per taken-branch iteration once the loop got OSR-compiled.**
  Root cause: the JIT emitter's `OP_POP` `last_imm` peephole — emit `dec %ecx`
  and skip `slot_decref` when the prior op pushed an immediate — is only sound
  for straight-line code. A *conditional* observed-assign (`if c: x is val`)
  compiles to an if-expression whose false arm pushes `NULL` and whose true
  arm leaves a heap pointer, both merging at a shared `POP`; the `NULL` set
  `last_imm=1`, so the merged `POP` dropped the true arm's pointer without
  decref'ing. Data-dependent (pointer rebinds leaked, number rebinds did not,
  through the *same* emitted code) and OSR-only — which is why #210's windowed
  `converged` exposed it in `genetic_optimize` (it removed an early exit).
- **Fix:** reset `last_imm` at every forward-jump target so a control-flow
  merge can no longer carry a stale immediate flag into the merged `POP`
  (`src/jit.c`). #211 first shipped a conservative stop-gap — the OSR scanner
  declined to compile loops through `OBSERVE_ASSIGN`/`OBSERVE_ASSIGN_LOCAL`,
  costing ≈16–34% on observed-assign hot loops — and #231 replaced it with the
  emitter fix and re-enabled OSR for those loops (n=5 microbench: ~34%
  recovered; standard benches unaffected; JIT output identical to
  `EIGS_JIT_OFF=1`).
- Regression guards: `tests/test_optimize.eigs` runs `genetic_optimize` for
  120 generations (was capped at 80 in #210 to dodge the leak), and
  `tests/test_osr_observe_assign.eigs` pins the conditional-merge case (it
  leaks 479 objects with the fix reverted). Both re-leak under ASan and bump
  the harness tally on regression.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-06-18

The #202 windowed-predicate series: all six observer predicates
(`converged`, `stable`, `oscillating`, `improving`, `diverging`,
`equilibrium`) now read a window of the last N observations instead of the
instantaneous `dH`, so they describe the recent trajectory and no longer
flicker on a single noisy step. The bands form an explicit lattice
(`converged ⊂ equilibrium`, high-entropy `equilibrium ⊂ stable`) and
`report` resolves the most specific. See docs/PREDICATES.md.

### Change — `stable` and `equilibrium` are now windowed predicates (#205, #209)

This completes the #202 windowed-predicate series: all six observer
predicates now read the dH window instead of the last step.

- **`equilibrium` (#209)** — new helper `observer_equilibrium`: full window
  (`count == N`) AND `|mean(window)| < dh_zero` AND
  `variance(window) < dh_zero²`. The value is at rest on average with
  negligible spread, regardless of entropy.
- **`stable` (#205)** — new helper `observer_stable`: full window AND every
  `|dH| < dh_small` AND `entropy >= h_low` AND no consecutive sign flips
  (adjacent opposite-sign pair both clearing `dh_zero`). Small but nonzero
  motion at high information content, holding direction.
- **The quiescent lattice is now explicit.** `converged ⊂ equilibrium`, and
  a *high-entropy* `equilibrium ⊂ stable`. A full quiet window is therefore
  `converged` (low entropy) or `equilibrium`+`stable` (high entropy);
  `equilibrium` never fires alone, and `report` resolves to the most
  specific band (`converged` then `equilibrium` then `stable`).
- **User-visible delta:** both predicates now require a *full* window
  (`count == N`) like `converged`, so a value at rest reports `stable` /
  `equilibrium` only after N observations, not on the first quiet step. For
  partial windows `report` falls back to an instantaneous best-effort label
  (see docs/PREDICATES.md → The `report` builtin), so `report`-driven code
  such as `lib/simulation.eigs` is unaffected.
- New tests: `tests/test_windowed_stable.eigs` (suite [8g]) and
  `tests/test_windowed_equilibrium.eigs` (suite [8h]), 8 checks each. The
  predicate matrix's `stable`/`equilibrium`/`converged` cases, the
  threshold-knob, and the `stable_band` / `halting_stall` /
  `report_alignment` / `windowed_converged` tests were migrated to
  full-window sequences. Two of those also surfaced (and now avoid) the
  last-observer-alias gotcha: reading `c is converged` before
  `e is equilibrium` repoints the alias, so both predicates are now read
  against the value in a single list expression.

### Change — `oscillating` is now a windowed predicate (#206)

- **`oscillating` and `report of x == "oscillating"` now count sign flips
  across the dH window instead of looking at the last two steps.** New
  shared helper `observer_oscillating` (used by both the `PREDICATE` op kind
  3 and the report builtin) is: `window_size >= 3` AND at least
  `FLIPS = ceil(N/3) = 4` sign flips across the window, where a flip is an
  adjacent dH pair with opposite signs whose magnitudes *both* clear
  `dh_zero` (sub-noise wobble does not count).
- **Deadband stays at `dh_zero`, not `dh_small`.** Unlike `improving` /
  `diverging`, oscillating is a deadband-escape test, not a direction
  verdict, so #187 deliberately left it on `dh_zero`: a gray-band
  alternation (`dh_zero < |dH| < dh_small`) still reads `oscillating`.
- **User-visible delta:** a single reversal (or one or two flips) in an
  otherwise monotone trajectory no longer reads `oscillating` — sustained
  back-and-forth now requires ≥ 4 flips, i.e. ≥ 5 observations / 4
  alternating steps. The old pointwise rule fired on the first sign flip.
- New tests: `tests/test_windowed_oscillating.eigs` (suite [8f], 8 checks:
  large/gray-band alternation, the exactly-4-flips boundary, sub-threshold
  flip counts, sub-noise wobble, monotone, single reversal, partial window).
  The predicate matrix's oscillation cases and `test_report_alignment` RA4
  were extended to sustained alternations (7 samples).

### Change — `diverging` is now a windowed predicate (#208)

- **`diverging` and `report of x == "diverging"` now read the dH window
  instead of the last step**, as the exact mirror of windowed `improving`
  (#207). New shared helper `observer_diverging` (used by both the
  `PREDICATE` op kind 4 and the report builtin) is:
  - `window_size >= 3`;
  - **`sum(window) > 0`** — net entropy *ascent* (magnitude-aware): a run
    that ends *more* determined than it started is never `diverging`, even
    if most steps ticked up;
  - **`up_fraction >= 0.6`** — ≥60% of steps are genuine ascents
    (`dH > +dh_small`), the proportional vote, with the `dh_small` threshold
    keeping a gray-band ascent out of `diverging` (it reads `stable`,
    honoring the #187 contract).
- **Mutual-exclusivity win:** a large-amplitude oscillation no longer
  co-fires `diverging`. The old pointwise rule (`dH > dh_small`) fired
  whenever the *last* tick happened to be a large up-step, so an
  oscillation read as both `oscillating` and `diverging`; the windowed rule
  needs a net trend + directional majority, which an oscillation has
  neither of. `report` still resolves `oscillating` first.
- **User-visible delta:** a noisy ascent (net up, majority of steps
  genuinely rising) reads `diverging`; a *net-improving* run, a *gray-band*
  steady ascent, and a sustained *oscillation* do not; fewer than 3
  observations never report `diverging`.
- New tests: `tests/test_windowed_diverging.eigs` (suite [8e], 8 checks
  mirroring [8d]). The predicate matrix's large-oscillation edge case now
  asserts `diverging = 0`, and `test_report_alignment` RA1 was migrated to a
  multi-step ascent.

### Change — `improving` is now a windowed predicate (#207)

- **`improving` and `report of x == "improving"` now read the dH window
  instead of the last step.** The pointwise rule (`dH < -dh_small`) fired
  on a single negative tick and dropped the claim the next frame if entropy
  bounced — it flickered under noise, which is the wrong behavior for the
  canonical `loop while improving` use. The windowed rule (shared helper
  `observer_improving`, used by both the `PREDICATE` op and the report
  builtin) is a hybrid of three independent tests:
  - `window_size >= 3` (partial-window rule — no claim on < 3 samples);
  - **`sum(window) < 0`** — the entropy fell on *net* over the window. This
    is magnitude-aware: a trajectory that ends with *higher* entropy than it
    started is never `improving`, even if most individual steps ticked down.
  - **`down_fraction >= 0.6`** — at least 60% of the steps are *genuine*
    descents, where a descent step is `dH < -dh_small`. The proportional
    vote (rather than an absolute bounce cap) tolerates noisy up-ticks
    without dropping a real descent; the `dh_small` threshold keeps a
    gray-band descent out of `improving` (see below).
- **This is a deliberate hybrid, not a restoration of any ancestor rule.**
  The legacy EigenChat *language* predicate was pointwise (radius
  decreasing), and its only *windowed* notion (`TemporalLossState`) was a
  magnitude-blind directional ratio vote that reports "improving" even on a
  net-worsening run. We keep that rule's noise tolerance (the proportional
  vote) but add the `sum < 0` magnitude gate so a net-worsening trajectory
  is never called improving.
- **Honors the #187 gray band.** The descent threshold is `dh_small`, not
  `dh_zero`, so a steady descent inside the gray band
  (`dh_zero <= |dH| < dh_small`) reads `stable`, not `improving` — the
  predicate family stays mutually exclusive and `improving` remains the
  windowed generalization of the pointwise rule it replaced.
- **User-visible delta:** a noisy descent (net down, majority of steps
  genuinely descending) now reads `improving` where the first windowed cut
  dropped it on a couple of bounces; a *net-worsening* run and a *gray-band*
  steady descent both read `stable`/their true state rather than
  `improving`; fewer than 3 observations never report `improving`.
- New tests: `tests/test_windowed_improving.eigs` (suite [8d], 8 checks
  covering monotone/noisy descent, net-up, gray-band, sub-majority, flat,
  ascent, and partial window). The predicate matrix's "stable" canonical
  case is a slow ascent so it stays stable-only under the new rule.

### Change — `assert` failures are now catchable (#220)

- **`assert of [cond, msg]` and `assert of cond` no longer call
  `exit(1)` on failure.** They set `g_has_error` + `g_error_msg` and
  return null, exactly like `throw`, so `vm_run` unwinds through any
  enclosing `try`/`catch` (catch binds the `"ASSERT FAIL: <msg>"`
  string). An uncaught assert still prints `ASSERT FAIL: <msg>` to
  stderr and exits non-zero — same observable behavior for scripts
  that don't wrap asserts in `try`.
- **Why the change:** `exit(1)` bypassed `main`'s teardown
  (`env_decref` of the global scope, `gc_collect_at_exit`,
  `chunk_free`), leaking every registered builtin + the global env +
  the AST every time an assertion failed. ASan flagged 25 KB / 198
  objects on `tests/test_assert_fail.eigs`. The runtime-error path is
  the canonical leak-clean way to abort.
- Programs that relied on assert being uncatchable (none known in
  the suite or examples) should restructure to use a sentinel that
  the catch handler rethrows, or fail the test by other means.

### Change — `converged` is now a windowed predicate (#204)

- **`converged` and `report of x == "converged"` now require a full
  10-step quiet window.** The pointwise rule (`|dH| < dh_zero &&
  entropy < h_low` on the current step alone) flagged any single-step
  quiet as converged, which fires spuriously on iterative schemes
  whose first quiet step is followed by more motion — Newton's method
  early in the descent, gradient descent crossing a saddle, an SA
  trajectory that happens to hold its energy for one step. The new
  rule requires the most recent `OBSERVER_WINDOW_N = 10` `dH` values
  to all be below `dh_zero` *and* current entropy below `h_low`. A
  value observed fewer than `N` times can no longer report
  `converged`; it reports `equilibrium` if `|dH| < dh_zero` or one
  of the active-trajectory bands otherwise. See
  [docs/PREDICATES.md](docs/PREDICATES.md) for the full spec.
- **Behavior change for short trajectories.** Programs that relied on
  `converged` firing after 1-2 assignments will now see `0` /
  `equilibrium`. The fix is to either prime with more observations or
  read `equilibrium` (which is still pointwise) for short runs. Loops
  that watch `loop while not converged` may run more iterations
  before exiting; ensure their `max_iter` cap is sufficient.
- **Internal:** lazy `dh_window` ring buffer on each tracked Value;
  allocation is gated on the compile-time observer-tracking flag, so
  values that no predicate or interrogative reads pay nothing. Buffer
  is moved (not copied) on `OBSERVE_ASSIGN` and freed before the
  VAL_NUM freelist path. Spec: [docs/PREDICATES.md](docs/PREDICATES.md).

### Fixed — memory-safety fixes since 0.15.3 (#212, #213, #214)

- **#212** — the VM builtin-arg wrapper heap-forces its list, so heap items
  stored in an arena-window container no longer leak their refs on arena
  reset.
- **#213** — `VAL_NULL` is no longer promoted to the heap (the singleton
  stays immortal); `slot_bridge_wrap` releases the heap-null refs it drops
  into the immediate-null slot encoding.
- **#214** — `eval` frees the partial AST returned by `parse` on the
  parse-error branch.

Together these dropped the ASan harness leak tally from 13 to 10.

## [0.15.3] — 2026-06-16

### Fix — `\r` is now a string-literal escape

- **`"\r"` produces ASCII CR (0x0D) instead of the literal char `'r'`.**
  The lexer's escape switches (regular `"..."` and f-strings `f"..."`,
  `src/lexer.c`) only handled `\n`, `\t`, `\`, and `\"`; `\r` fell to
  the default branch, which dropped the backslash and kept `'r'`. Real
  on-disk CRLF in files was always handled correctly by the C scanners
  (`scan_ints`, `scan_int_tokens`, `scan_tokens`) because `isspace('\r')`
  is true — the gap only bit anyone constructing CRLF test data inline.
- **Behavior change for any program that wrote `"\r"` and expected `'r'`**
  (unlikely; the escape was undocumented). To get a literal `'r'`,
  remove the backslash.

### Fix — observer predicates honor the gray band (#187)

- **`improving` / `diverging` now switch at `dh_small`, matching
  `report`.** Previously they switched at `dh_zero`, so in the gray
  band (`dh_zero ≤ |dH| < dh_small`) the predicates collided with
  `stable` (which already used `dh_small`) and disagreed with
  `report of x`. A value parked at `dH = -0.005` with default
  thresholds read as **both** `stable` and `improving` simultaneously
  while `report` returned `"stable"`. The predicate family is now
  internally consistent and agrees with `report` across the whole
  range. `oscillating` is unchanged — it gates on `dh_zero` as a
  deadband-escape test, not a direction verdict.
- **Behavior change for documented predicates.** Programs reading
  `improving` or `diverging` in the gray band will now see `0` where
  they previously saw `1`. The `report` keyword, the predicate-vs-
  report contract, and `stable` are unchanged.

## [0.15.2] — 2026-06-15

### Fix — macOS Intel JIT enabled

- **macos-x86_64 ships with the JIT live again.** The 0.14.2 holding
  pattern (`EIGENSCRIPT_JIT_FORCE_OFF=1` on Darwin x86_64) is gone. The
  root cause was that the JIT prologue inlined Linux ELF
  `mov %fs:eigs_current_tpoff, %rbx` for TLS, which has no Mach-O
  equivalent — every thunk SIGSEGV'd on first entry. Fix:
  - Prologue is platform-split. Darwin calls a C helper
    `eigs_jit_load_eigs_current()` in `src/vm.c` (the C compiler emits
    the TLV descriptor sequence around the load) and copies `%rax` to
    `%rbx`. Linux keeps the inline `%fs:tpoff` read. End-state is the
    same — `%rbx = EigsThread*` — and the existing
    `mov off_thread_vm(%rbx), %rbx` resolves the VM pointer identically
    on both.
  - Mid-thunk reads of `eigs_current` (unobserved_depth guards) can't
    derive the thread back from `%rbx` because `vm` is a heap-allocated
    `VM*`, not embedded. Added `struct EigsThread *owner` to `VM` (set
    in `vm_init`), exposed via `off_vm_owner` in `EigsJitLayout`. The
    three mid-thunk sites do `mov off_vm_owner(%rbx), %rax` followed by
    a probe at `off_thread_unobserved_depth(%rax)`. Same encoding on
    both platforms — no `#ifdef` in the thunk body.
  - The dict-field inline cache stays off on Darwin (`dcache_ways=0`
    in the layout trips the existing `dcache_ways == 2` guard), so
    `LOCAL_DOT_GET/SET` route to the slow-path helper. Porting the
    inline probe is the only remaining Darwin-specific follow-on.
- **CI**: `macos-15-intel` is now in the `build-and-test` matrix, so
  every push runs the full 1855-check suite with JIT live on macOS x86_64.
  The `[82]` thunk-gate's Darwin skip is gone.
- `EIGENSCRIPT_JIT_FORCE_OFF` stays in `src/jit.c` as a bisection kill
  switch but is no longer set by `build.sh`.

## [0.15.1] — 2026-06-15

### HTTP `http_route_authed`: source-based auth via shared store

- `http_route_authed`'s auth check now resolves the auth source from
  `shared_get("require_auth")` first, with the legacy
  `require_auth`-function fallback in the worker env preserved for
  back-compat. When the shared key is a string, the worker tokenizes/
  parses/compiles/executes it per request in a fresh env on top of
  the worker's global. Empty `value_to_string` result = allow; any
  non-empty result becomes the 401 body verbatim.
- Closes the multi-state gap that broke `http_route_authed`: a
  function value can't cross worker boundaries (each worker dies with
  its arena), but a *string source* can — and re-evaluating it per
  request reaches the same semantics. Hosts publish a session table
  or token-validity flag via `shared_set` and write the auth check as
  a small script that consults it.
- Tests: HS24–HS26 in `tests/test_http_server.sh` — `/asetup` seeds
  `require_auth` as the source `shared_get of "auth_msg"`; flipping
  `auth_msg` between `""` and `"denied by test"` toggles 200/401, and
  the message round-trips into the 401 body. HS26 proves the source
  is re-evaluated per request, not cached at registration.

### HTTP shared store: `shared_incr(key, delta)` for atomic counters

- New builtin `shared_incr of [key, delta]`. Single-lock read-modify-
  write — reads current numeric value, adds `delta`, writes back, and
  returns the new value, all under the existing shared-store mutex.
  Missing key is treated as 0 (so the first call inserts the key);
  an existing non-numeric value is a usage error and returns `null`
  without mutating. Subject to the same byte cap as `shared_set`.
- Closes the RMW gap the original `shared_set + shared_get` API had:
  HS23 fires 32 concurrent `/sinc` calls and verifies that every
  integer in 1..32 appears exactly once in the responses and the next
  call returns 33. Holds under ASan slowdown too.

### HTTP shared store: bounded by `EIGS_HTTP_SHARED_MAX_BYTES`

- Total key + JSON-value bytes across the shared store are now capped
  (default 64 MiB; override via env). `shared_set` rejects writes that
  would push the total past the cap and returns `null` without mutating
  storage — predictable refusal, no eviction.
- HS22 in `tests/test_http_server.sh` verifies the cap: a server
  launched with `EIGS_HTTP_SHARED_MAX_BYTES=4096` rejects an 8 KiB
  write, and `shared_has` confirms the store stayed clean.

### HTTP shared store: cross-worker key/value primitive

- **New builtins**: `shared_set(k,v)`, `shared_get(k)`, `shared_has(k)`,
  `shared_delete(k)`, `shared_keys()`, `shared_size()`, `shared_clear()`.
  Available in main and worker code-route contexts (registered via
  `register_http_request_builtins`, so workers get them automatically).
- **Storage**: keyed map on the main `EigsHttpServer`. Values are
  JSON-serialized on `shared_set` (`eigs_json_encode`, now publicly
  exposed) and re-parsed on `shared_get` into a value owned by the
  caller's `EigsState`. JSON-as-storage sidesteps cross-state `Value*`
  lifetime — workers die with their arena, the stored string stays
  heap-owned by the Server.
- **Concurrency**: a `pthread_mutex_t` on the Server guards every op,
  so individual reads/writes are atomic. The API does **not** provide
  read-modify-write atomicity (no CAS / increment primitive yet) —
  scripts that need it must serialize externally, or risk losing
  updates under concurrent writers.
- **Effect on `http_route_authed`**: a startup script can now publish
  a session table (or token-validity flag, or rate-limit bucket) via
  `shared_set`, and authed `code` routes look it up via `shared_get`.
  Function values still can't be shared (encoded as `null` per
  `json_encode` semantics) — the route source itself runs the auth
  check, what crosses the worker boundary is the *data* it checks.
- **Tests**: HS17–HS21 in `tests/test_http_server.sh` — string and
  nested-dict round-trips across worker states, `shared_delete`,
  `shared_clear` + size, 32 concurrent `shared_get` calls all return
  the intact value.

### HTTP `code` routes evaluate in a per-worker `EigsState` (concurrency + isolation)

- **Each connection now runs its `code` route in a fresh worker
  `EigsState`** (created in `http_conn_thread` via `eigs_state_new` +
  `eigs_thread_attach` + `register_builtins`). The worker's global env
  starts empty — `code` route source has access to stdlib and the
  per-request HTTP builtins, but **does not see any globals defined
  by the startup script**, and mutations in one request never leak
  into another.
- **Why this changes behavior.** Previously, workers were detached
  pthreads that set `eigs_http_active` but never called
  `eigs_thread_attach`, so `vm_execute` inside a worker ran with
  `eigs_current == NULL` and the bridge macros derefed null — `code`
  routes were structurally unsafe from worker threads. With a real
  `EigsState` attached per worker, they're safe to evaluate, including
  concurrently across many connections.
- **Migration:** `code` routes that closed over startup-time globals
  (counters, route registries, request logs) will see those globals
  missing. To share state across requests, use a host-provided shared
  store (planned next; until then, `code` routes must be self-contained
  or read shared state through `http_post`/file I/O). `http_route_authed`
  regresses to 500 unless `require_auth` is self-contained in the route
  source — auth on shared session state is blocked on the shared-store
  primitive.
- **New tests:** `tests/test_http_server.sh` HS14 (code route runs and
  returns the last expression), HS15 (10 sequential calls each see
  fresh state), HS16 (16 concurrent calls all return the isolated
  value — proves no cross-worker globals trampling).
- **Internal split:** `register_http_request_builtins` exposes the
  read-the-current-request subset (`http_request_body`,
  `http_session_id`, `http_request_headers`, `http_post`) without
  allocating a `Server` — useful for any future embedder that wants
  to host code routes from its own worker pool.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-06-15

### Embedding API — `eigs_embed.h` makes the runtime hostable from C (multi-state refactor, Phase 10)

- **Public C surface for embedding EigenScript in a host program.**
  `src/eigs_embed.h` exposes a small, opaque API: state/thread
  lifecycle (`eigs_open`/`eigs_close`, or the finer-grained
  `eigs_state_new` + `eigs_thread_attach` + `eigs_state_init_runtime`
  for hosts that need to attach multiple OS threads to the same
  state), source eval (`eigs_eval_string`, `eigs_eval_file` — both
  REPL-style, so top-level names accumulate in the global env and
  the host can read them back through `eigs_get_global`), error
  retrieval (`eigs_last_error_message`/`eigs_has_error`/
  `eigs_clear_error`), ref-counted `EigsValue` handles with
  num/string/list/dict constructors + type inspection + accessors,
  and FFI registration (`eigs_register_function` adopts the existing
  `BuiltinFn` shape so a C function receives a single `EigsValue *arg`
  — raw value for 1-arg calls, `VAL_LIST` for multi-arg).
- **`src/embed_smoke.c` is the contract test.** A standalone host
  harness that registers a `host_add` C function, evaluates scripts
  that read host-set globals and call back into C, and checks the
  error path through an undefined-name lookup. Wired up as `make
  embed-smoke` (links the runtime minus `main.c` the same way `make
  fuzz`/`make lsp` do, so it stays in lockstep with the runtime).
- **Wraps the multi-state refactor (Phases 1–9, lifted every
  `__thread` global onto `EigsState` per-interpreter or `EigsThread`
  per-OS-thread).** The embedding API is what those nine phases were
  building toward — they did the structural work; Phase 10 just gives
  embedders a stable, opaque contract that doesn't expose the
  internal bridge-macro identifiers (`g_global_env`, `g_has_error`,
  etc.). Net effect: a C/C++ host can now embed multiple interpreter
  instances concurrently in the same process, each with its own
  global env, JIT cache, module cache, observer thresholds, and
  per-thread arena/error state.
- Suite: release 1855/1855; ASan 1855/1855 with the unchanged
  13-program leak tally. All variants (release, http, lsp,
  jit-smoke, embed-smoke) build clean.

### Package tool — `<owner>/<name>` is now required

- **`--pkg add` rejects bare package names.** Identifiers must be
  `<owner>/<name>` (e.g. `alice/tensor`); `install`, `update`, and
  `verify` also fail-fast on a manifest with bare-name dep keys.
  Reserving the namespace at the manifest layer from day one
  prevents a popularity spike from fragmenting it onto bare leaves;
  bare-name retrofit would otherwise be unrecoverable since every
  shipped lockfile would already have keys baked in. On-disk layout
  and the user-facing `import <name>` form stay flat (the leaf, just
  `<name>`) — two packages with the same leaf still can't coexist,
  but disk-level nesting and scoped imports can land later without
  breaking existing manifests. README, CONTRIBUTING, PACKAGE_DESIGN
  updated; `tests/test_pkg_{fetch,verify_update,skeleton}.sh` cover
  the new rejection paths.

## [0.14.2] — 2026-06-13

### Ship — macOS Intel binary, interpreter-only

- **macos-x86_64 release binary now ships JIT-disabled at build time.**
  The MAP_JIT switch in 0.14.1 wasn't enough — thunks still SIGSEGV on
  first entry on the macos-15-intel runner, with a failure pattern that
  doesn't match the standard hardened-runtime symptoms (Intel
  pthread_jit_write_protect_np is a no-op, MAP_JIT is set, the compile
  is clean, simple interpreter tests pass). Root cause is unresolved
  and not reproducible without a macOS Intel machine, so 0.14.2 takes
  the pragmatic route: `build.sh` defines
  `EIGENSCRIPT_JIT_FORCE_OFF=1` when `uname -s = Darwin && uname -m =
  x86_64`, `src/jit.c`'s `jit_try_compile_chunk[_osr]` honor it as an
  early return, and `tests/run_all_tests.sh`'s `[82]` thunk-gate skips
  on Darwin x86_64 the way it already does on non-x86_64. Net effect
  for users: the macos-x86_64 binary is interpreter-only (≈3–5× slower
  on hot loops); correctness is unchanged. macOS arm64 was already
  interpreter-only (no ARM64 emitter yet), so this gap is now
  consistent across Apple platforms. v0.14.0 and v0.14.1 tags exist on
  the remote but never produced artifacts — first published release of
  the 0.14 line is 0.14.2.

## [0.14.1] — 2026-06-13

### Fix — macOS Intel JIT page mapping

- **JIT cache pages now use `MAP_JIT` + `pthread_jit_write_protect_np`
  on Apple platforms.** The previous
  `mmap(PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE)` → `mprotect(PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC)` W→X
  transition is rejected under macOS 15's hardened runtime — every
  thunk SIGSEGV'd on first entry, taking 348/1857 tests down on the
  macos-15-intel runner during the 0.14.0 release build. The
  macos-x86_64 runner is new for 0.14.0; v0.13.0's single-job workflow
  never exercised it, so the failure mode was latent. `src/jit.c`
  branches on `__APPLE__` for the mapping flags and seal/unseal
  primitives; Linux behavior is unchanged. macos-arm64 stays
  interpreter-only (the JIT itself remains x86_64-gated).
- Suite remains 1857/1857 release + ASan with `detect_leaks=1` (leak
  tally still 13).

## [0.14.0] — 2026-06-13

### Trust/identity — OpenSSF badge, CodeQL, Scorecard 7.5/10, signed releases, OSS-Fuzz in flight

- **OpenSSF Best Practices passing badge earned** (project 13187,
  100% at 2026-06-13 09:27 UTC —
  https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/13187). Badge embed lives in
  the README alongside CI/Release/License/Stars. Silver sits at 13%
  and gold at 22%; the gaps are governance/DCO/vulnerability-response
  process families, not core security work.
- **CodeQL workflow** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) runs the
  `security-and-quality` query pack on every push, every PR, and a
  weekly cron — added to satisfy `static_analysis` and to surface
  alerts in the repo's Security tab. Triage the same cadence as
  ASan/leak-tally failures.
- **OpenSSF Scorecard 7.5/10** (`.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`):
  10/10 on twelve checks including SAST, CI-Tests, Fuzzing,
  Dependency-Update-Tool, Pinned-Dependencies, Token-Permissions,
  Maintained, Security-Policy, License, Vulnerabilities,
  Dangerous-Workflow, Binary-Artifacts. Workflow hardening: every
  third-party action is pinned to its commit SHA (Dependabot config
  added for weekly bumps); top-level workflow tokens default to
  read-only with `contents: write` / `pages: write` / `id-token: write`
  scoped to the jobs that need them. Remaining gaps are structural
  (solo Code-Review, Branch-Protection vs. direct-push workflow) or
  bump only at Gold-tier Best Practices.
- **Signed releases via Sigstore build provenance**
  (`actions/attest-build-provenance` in `release.yml`). Every release
  binary — `eigenscript-{linux,macos}-{x86_64,arm64}` and the Linux
  `eigenscript-full` variant — gets a keyless attestation written to
  the GitHub attestations API, plus an `attestation.sigstore.json`
  bundle uploaded alongside the binaries for offline verification.
  Per-binary verification: `gh attestation verify eigenscript-<label>
  --repo InauguralSystems/EigenScript`. This is the first EigenScript
  release to ship signed artifacts.
- **OSS-Fuzz enrollment**: PR google/oss-fuzz#15720 submitted from the
  InauguralSystems org fork with the CLA signed; all checks green
  except trial-build (NEUTRAL, non-blocking). The libFuzzer harness
  (`fuzz/fuzz_eigenscript.c`) was rewritten to drive the current
  bytecode pipeline (the AST-interpreter-era harness had bitrotted),
  paired with a keyword/punctuation/builtin dictionary
  (`fuzz/eigenscript.dict`) and a `make fuzz-libfuzzer` target
  (`clang -fsanitize=fuzzer,address,undefined`).

### Package ecosystem — CONTRIBUTING section + awesome-eigenscript (package design Phase 2)

- **CONTRIBUTING.md gains a "Publishing a Package" section.** Covers
  naming (lowercase identifiers, no hyphens, stdlib name reservations),
  semver discipline (cut new tags rather than force-pushing), the
  privacy convention (leading underscore), the "no top-level side
  effects" footgun, and where to list a published package.
- **New repo: [InauguralSystems/awesome-eigenscript](
  https://github.com/InauguralSystems/awesome-eigenscript).** Curated
  index of packages, tools, learning resources, and editor integrations.
  A list, not a registry — the package tool resolves packages by git
  URL, so this index is purely for discoverability. PRs add one entry
  per package; inclusion gated on tagged release + smoke test in CI.

### Package starter — `eigs-package-template` (package design Phase 1 wrap)

- **New repo: [InauguralSystems/eigs-package-template](
  https://github.com/InauguralSystems/eigs-package-template).** A
  forkable starting point for an EigenScript package: `eigs.json` +
  `<name>.eigs` at the root, MIT license, a smoke test that stages
  the package into `eigs_modules/<name>/` and imports it the way a
  consumer would, and a CI workflow that builds EigenScript from
  source. Tagged `v0.1.0` to demonstrate the semver workflow.
- The Phase 1 design called for this; it lands as a sibling repo
  rather than docs in this tree so authors `gh repo fork` it.

### Package tool — `--pkg verify` + `--pkg update` (package design Phase 1c)

- **`--pkg verify`** re-checks every installed dep against the lockfile.
  Three failure modes per package: the checkout is missing, `HEAD`
  differs from the locked commit, or the working tree has been edited
  (`git status --porcelain` non-empty). Exits nonzero (via `throw`) if
  any package fails so CI can gate on it.
- **`--pkg update [name]`** re-resolves the manifest tag to its current
  `HEAD` and re-locks. With no arg, walks every dep; with a name, only
  that one (unknown name → nonzero exit). The manifest itself is
  unchanged — `update` moves only the lockfile.
- **Lockfile gains a `tree` field**: git's `HEAD^{tree}` SHA, recorded
  by `add` / `install` / `update` and re-checked by `verify`. The
  commit SHA already nails down git history; the tree hash is the
  content-addressed identifier of the tree itself, and pre-1c
  lockfiles are backfilled on the next `install`.
- Suite gains section [96] (`tests/test_pkg_verify_update.sh`,
  7 checks): clean verify, tampered-tree verify, missing-checkout
  verify, update no-op on unchanged tag, update advances lockfile
  after a tag move, unknown-name update exits nonzero, and verify
  accepts the post-update state.

### Package tool — `--pkg add` + `--pkg install` actually fetch (package design Phase 1b)

- **`--pkg add <name> <url> [tag]` now clones the dep** into
  `eigs_modules/<name>/` via `git clone --depth 1 --branch <tag>`,
  resolves `HEAD` with `git -C <dir> rev-parse HEAD`, and records
  `{git, tag, commit}` in `eigs.lock.json`. The manifest write
  happens *before* the network step so a failed clone leaves a
  recoverable on-disk state — re-run `--pkg install` to retry.
- **`--pkg install` reproduces `eigs_modules/` from the lockfile.**
  For each manifest dep: wipe the target dir, re-clone at the manifest
  tag, then — if the lockfile pins a commit — `git fetch --depth 1
  origin <commit>` + `git checkout <commit>` so a force-pushed tag
  cannot sneak a different tree past the lock. Install is idempotent
  (re-running over a populated `eigs_modules/` is a no-op-equivalent
  refresh) and never leaves the tree in a half-state.
- **No code from the dep is executed at install time** — the runtime
  only ever loads `eigs_modules/<name>/<name>.eigs` when the user
  script actually `import`s it.
- Suite gains section [95] (`tests/test_pkg_fetch.sh`): builds a
  local `file://` git repo as a fake remote, runs the full add →
  import → install round-trip, and verifies the lockfile-wins-over-
  moved-tag invariant by force-retagging the source.

### Package tool — `--pkg` skeleton (package design Phase 1a)

- **New CLI: `eigenscript --pkg <subcommand>`.** Dispatcher loads
  `lib/pkg.eigs` and forwards subcommand args to it. Wired alongside
  `--fmt` and `--lint` in `src/main.c`. The tool is written in
  EigenScript itself (`lib/pkg.eigs`) so it dogfoods the JSON,
  subprocess, and file-I/O surface.
- **Subcommands landed: `list`, `add`, `help`.** `add` writes the dep
  to `eigs.json`; `list` prints what's recorded plus the locked
  commit if present in `eigs.lock.json`. `install`, `verify`,
  `update` are stubs in this slice — they land in Phase 1b and 1c.
- **Unknown subcommand exits nonzero** via `throw`, so CI / shell
  pipelines fail loudly on typos. The manifest and lockfile use the
  built-in `json_encode`/`json_decode` — no new dependency.

### Modules — import cache + per-file resolution + eigs_modules/ (package design Phase 0a/b/c)

- **`import name` now searches `eigs_modules/<name>/<name>.eigs`,
  walking upward from the importing file's directory to the project
  root** (a directory containing `eigs.json`, checked once and then
  the walk halts). Only fires for bare `<name>.eigs` requests, so
  paths with directory components fall through the existing chain
  unchanged. Walks are bounded to 64 levels. This is the runtime hook
  for the `eigs_modules/` layout that the future `--pkg` tool will
  populate; the resolver gains the lookup now so a hand-curated
  `eigs_modules/` works today.
- **Resolver ordering.** Within the `import` resolver chain, the
  package step sits between the cwd-relative check and the
  importer-dir (`base`) check, so a packaged dep wins over a
  loose file next to the importer. Stdlib and `eigs_modules/` may
  collide on a name; the future `--pkg add` tool will reject collisions
  at install time per the design.

- **`import` now caches the resolved module.** The first import of a
  module executes its body; subsequent imports of the same resolved
  absolute path bind the same dict and reuse the same module Env. A
  side-effecting top-level statement (e.g. `print of "init"`) runs
  exactly once across all importers; diamond dependencies (`a → c`,
  `b → c`) share one instance of `c`'s state. Cache is keyed on the
  `realpath`-canonicalized resolved path so different relative routes
  to the same file hit the same entry. Cleared in `gc_collect_at_exit`
  before the global-scope snapshot.
- **`import` inside a module resolves relative to *that module's*
  directory.** Previously every nested import searched from the main
  script's directory, so a submodule couldn't reliably reach its own
  peers. Now the resolver's script-relative step anchors at the
  importing file's own directory (derived from its `realpath`-
  canonicalized absolute path, so symlinks and `..` segments are
  flattened). The other steps in the chain (cwd, exe-relative, stdlib
  `$HOME/.local/lib/eigenscript`) are unchanged.
- **Observable behavior change.** Programs that relied on per-import
  re-execution of side-effecting modules will see one execution
  instead. Programs that worked around the main-script-relative
  resolver by placing submodule peers next to the entry point can now
  colocate them with their importer. The dict shape, member names, and
  binding semantics are unchanged. This is the runtime prerequisite
  for the package design (docs/PACKAGE_DESIGN.md) and is documented in
  SPEC.md — Modules.

### Runtime — small perf wins (issue #174)

- **Compiler dedups `OP_LINE` per basic block.** The compiler stamped a
  fresh `OP_LINE` for every AST node, so `total is total + i` emitted
  three back-to-back updates to the same line. Now `emit_line` skips
  the write when the line hasn't moved, resetting at every basic-block
  boundary (jump targets, loop tops, after `OP_CALL`/`OP_DISPATCH`, fn
  entry) so the runtime `current_line` invariant never weakens. Bench:
  `while 100k` 6.45 → 6.05 ms (~6% n=5 median, T3200).
- **String concat allocates once.** `OP_ADD`'s string path went
  `malloc → make_str (strdup) → free` — two allocations and a copy per
  `+`. Now it `xmalloc`s the joined buffer directly and hands it to
  `make_str_owned`. Bench: `strcat 2k` 9.6 → 8.79 ms (~8% n=5 median).
- **`ITER_NEXT` buffer fast path skips the `make_num` round-trip.**
  When the for-loop's iterable is a buffer (homogeneous doubles), the
  yielded element now flows through the stack as an immediate-num slot
  via `vm_push_slot(slot_from_num(...))` instead of allocating a fresh
  `VAL_NUM` per iteration. Bench: `for in range of 50000` 25.1 → 22.1
  ms (~12% n=5 median, T3200). The list-iterable path is unchanged.

### Runtime — closure-cycle collector

- **The env↔fn closure-cycle leak is fixed** (docs/CLOSURE_CYCLE_GC.md).
  Escaping closures — `define inner ... return inner`, counters,
  per-iteration handler closures, method dicts — are now reclaimed, both
  mid-run (registry-threshold collections triggered at closure-capture
  time, zero cost on the dispatch hot paths) and at exit. A
  100k-iteration closure-churn loop runs ~40% faster with peak RSS down
  from ~124 MB to ~4 MB; long-running programs that build closures over
  time no longer grow without bound.
- **`Env` lifetime is an honest refcount.** `env_refcount` now counts
  every owner: the creating frame or C caller, closures, child envs (the
  `parent` link is an owned edge), and a chunk's parked recycled call
  env. `env_free`'s captured-gated semantics are replaced by plain
  `env_incref`/`env_decref`; loop-scope envs move the frame's ref
  explicitly. This also fixes latent leaks on early `return` from inside
  a loop scope and makes the env-recycling parent compare
  dangling-pointer-free.
- **Exit teardown reclaims global-scope value cycles** too (e.g. a list
  appended to itself), via a pinned snapshot of global bindings before
  the final collection. `import` module envs are released when the last
  closure defined in them dies (previously leaked unconditionally).
- The collector is conservative by construction: roots are derived from
  refcounts (any uncounted holder makes a node a root), and an
  accounting mismatch aborts the collection — the failure mode is a
  leak, never a use-after-free. Disabled once `spawn` goes
  multithreaded; spawned programs keep the previous behavior.
- Suite: `tests/test_closure_cycles.eigs` (now 17 checks, incl. dict-
  routed cycles and 500 discarded counters) is gated **strictly**
  leak-clean under ASan — section [87] no longer tolerates a
  LeakSanitizer exit. The suite-wide tolerated-leak tally drops 28 → 13;
  every remaining report is byte-identical to the pre-collector
  baseline (spawn-thread programs + pre-existing non-closure shapes).

### Distribution — macOS release binaries, checksums, stability contract

- The Release workflow now builds and publishes macOS binaries —
  `eigenscript-macos-x86_64` (Intel, JIT enabled) and
  `eigenscript-macos-arm64` (Apple Silicon, interpreter-only until the
  ARM64 JIT exists) — alongside the Linux assets, each leg running the
  full suite against the exact binary it uploads. Releases also gain a
  `CHECKSUMS` file (`sha256sum -c` / `shasum -a 256 -c` verifiable).
- The Makefile's hardened link flags (`-z relro`/`-z now`) are now
  Linux-only: macOS's ld64 rejects them, which silently broke every
  Makefile link target on macOS — `make lsp` most visibly. The macOS CI
  leg now compile-checks the LSP so this can't regress unseen.
- README gains a **Stability** section: the executable spec
  (docs/SPEC.md) is the pre-1.0 compatibility surface — patch releases
  never change documented behavior, minor releases may with a CHANGELOG
  entry, and everything outside the spec is explicitly unstable.
- docs/PACKAGE_DESIGN.md: the package/dependency **design proposal**
  (vendored `eigs_modules/`, git-pinned manifest + lockfile, `--pkg`
  tool, install executes nothing). Nothing implemented; open questions
  listed for decision.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-06-12

A language-features release.

### Language — structured errors, stack traces, user modules

- **`throw` preserves the thrown value.** `throw of {"kind": ..., ...}`
  now binds the *dict* (or list, or any value) to the catch variable
  instead of a stringified copy — errors can carry data and be matched
  on fields. Thrown strings and runtime errors bind as strings, exactly
  as before; a runtime error raised while a structured value is in
  flight supersedes it. (`tests/test_trycatch.eigs` 13 → 23 checks.)
- **Uncaught errors print a stack trace**: every frame between the
  failure and the top level, innermost first, with function name and
  line (`at inner (line 6)` / `at <module> (line 9)`), resolved from
  each frame's saved ip via the chunk line tables. Applies to runtime
  errors and uncaught `throw` alike; stderr-only, so program output
  and the error-message contract are unchanged.
- **`import` loads user modules.** When `lib/<name>.eigs` doesn't
  exist, `import name` falls back to `<name>.eigs` resolved relative
  to the script (then the other standard locations) — same namespaced
  dict binding, nothing in global scope. The not-found error now names
  both tried paths. (`tests/test_import.eigs` 12 → 17 checks.)
- docs/SPEC.md: `import` documented for the first time (executed
  examples, stdlib + user module), structured-throw and stack-trace
  sections added; new `examples/errors/uncaught_with_trace.eigs`.

### Tooling — editor support and published docs

- **`editors/vscode/`** — VS Code extension: TextMate grammar (keywords,
  interrogatives, predicates, f-string interpolation, definitions and
  call sites, `|>`/`=>`), comment toggling, bracket/auto-indent rules.
  Symlink into `~/.vscode/extensions/` or package with vsce.
- **`editors/vim/`** — Vim/Neovim syntax + ftdetect for `.eigs`.
- **`.gitattributes`** maps `.eigs` to Python highlighting on github.com
  until a Linguist grammar is upstreamed.
- **Docs site** — `.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes `docs/` via
  GitHub Pages (Jekyll, relative links resolved; the workflow provisions
  Pages itself on first run). Requires a public repo or paid plan.
- `VERSION` bumped to 0.13.0. Releases: push a `v*` tag **or** dispatch
  the Release workflow — it creates the tag itself (version defaults to
  the VERSION file) and builds in the same run, since environments
  exist that can't push tags and GITHUB_TOKEN-pushed tags don't
  retrigger workflows.
- Doc-example checker runs each example with cwd = its own script dir
  (the macOS Python tempdir is /var/folders/..., not /tmp — examples
  must not assume either).

### Fix — buffer index-assignment kept only the integer part

`b[i] is 1.5` stored `1.0` while `buf_set of [b, i, 1.5]` stored `1.5`:
all four interpreter INDEX_SET arms carried an `(int)` cast on the
stored value, and the JIT's inline buffer store round-tripped through
`cvttsd2si`/`cvtsi2sd` — even though `buffer.data` is `double*` and
nothing documents truncation. Found while writing the executable spec
(its buffer example produced the wrong output). Index-assignment now
stores the full double in the interpreter and the JIT alike, agreeing
with `buf_set`. Regression checks in `test_builtin_indirect.eigs`
(fraction kept, agrees with buf_set, negative fractions) and
`test_jit_paths.eigs` (fractional stores through the hot inline path).

### Docs — executable spec, comparison guide, error corpus

The "AI-legibility" round: documentation a human or a model can trust
because the suite executes it.

- **`docs/SPEC.md`** — canonical spec: every construct with a runnable
  example and its exact output. 38 example/output pairs are executed by
  the new `tests/test_doc_examples.py` (suite section [89]) and must
  match byte-for-byte, so the spec cannot drift from the
  implementation.
- **`docs/COMPARISON.md`** — EigenScript next to Python/JS/Rust/Lisp
  with a porting checklist and before/after transformations; the
  EigenScript halves are suite-verified the same way (11 pairs).
- **`examples/errors/`** — nine programs that fail on purpose, each
  declaring its expected message in an `# expect-error:` header,
  enforced by `tests/test_error_examples.sh` (section [90]).
- **`docs/README.md`** — documentation map; README points at it and at
  the spec.

### LSP — parse-error diagnostics now actually appear

The language server advertised `publishDiagnostics` but never sent a
non-empty one: `send_diagnostics` gated on `g_error_msg`, which the
parser/lexer never populate on a syntax error (they only print to
stderr). So the editor's headline feature — red squiggles on bad
syntax — was dead. The lexer/parser now record the first syntax error
of each tokenize+parse pass (line + message) via a new additive
`eigs_record_first_error` hook — reset at the top of `tokenize()`,
captured at the common sites (unexpected character, unterminated
string, indentation mismatch, `expected X got Y`) — and the LSP turns
it into a diagnostic at the correct 0-based line. The CLI's stderr
output is byte-for-byte unchanged (the capture is purely additive).
New `tests/test_lsp.py` / `test_lsp.sh` (suite section [88], 23 checks)
drive the server over real Content-Length-framed JSON-RPC and assert
initialize capabilities, the now-working diagnostics (clean → none;
syntax errors → right line + message; `didChange` clears them),
completion, hover, definition, references, and `shutdown`/`exit` — the
LSP was previously only compile-checked.

### Closure-cycle leak — investigated; scoped as a reviewed project

A captured `Env` and the closure bound within it form a refcount cycle
the runtime can't reclaim. Confirmed it **accumulates** (~12
allocations per escaping closure; 500 → ~6,000 leaked), correcting
earlier text that implied a bounded exit-time blip. Investigated all
three fix options and recorded why none is a safe drive-by patch
(`docs/CLOSURE_CYCLE_GC.md`): weak self-binding either way introduces
use-after-free (non-escaping recursion / escaping returns), and a
collector is blocked by `Env` having no uniform refcount (trial
deletion) or needing intrusive all-objects registries plus complete
root enumeration (mark-sweep) — a change whose failure mode is memory
corruption, so it belongs in a dedicated reviewed effort, not here.
`tests/test_closure_cycles.eigs` (section [87], 14 checks) pins the
functional correctness of every cycle shape and the non-leaking
invariants (self-referential containers, non-escaping recursion stay
clean) so a regression toward UAF or a wider leak is caught. The
re-examined "dead code" candidates (`tok_type_name`, uncalled `env_*`
helpers, unreachable lint rules) are defensive or public-header API —
left in place rather than churned to game a coverage number.

### Testing & CI — coverage-gap closure

A gcov pass over the suite (`docs/TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md`) drove a
round of test, runner, build, and runtime fixes:

- **Lambda closures no longer leak their defining env.** `OP_CLOSURE`
  bumped `env_refcount` *and* `make_fn` took the fn's own ref — the
  extra count had no owner, so a call env that created any closure
  could never drop to zero. A fn returned as a lambda (no self-binding)
  now frees its env when the last fn ref dies. The remaining known leak
  is the env↔fn cycle of `define`-bound closures (`define inner` lives
  *in* the env that `inner` captures) — refcounting alone cannot
  reclaim it; the suite runner tolerates LeakSanitizer-only nonzero
  exits and tallies them in the final summary.
- **Suite sections gate on exit codes** (`rc_ok` / `check_eigs_suite`
  in `run_all_tests.sh`): a crash after correct output now fails the
  section instead of slipping past the marker grep (previously only
  check [71] asserted rc).
- **Wired in orphaned tests**: `test_fmt.sh` (14 checks) and
  `test_lint.sh` (10, plus a cwd-bitrot fix) — fmt.c/lint.c were at 0%
  line coverage; 28 orphaned `.eigs` suites ([85]); compound
  dot-assignment (`d.k += v`, `items[i].f += v`) which had zero
  coverage of its clone_ast desugaring.
- **New suites**: `test_jit_paths.eigs` ([82], checksummed coverage of
  the Stage-5 fused opcodes, inline-IC slow paths, OSR, and JIT
  helpers, with an EIGS_JIT_STATS gate so it can't silently pass
  interpreted), `test_walker_matrix.eigs` ([83], closure capture per
  AST node kind — the #156 bug class), `test_builtin_indirect.eigs`
  ([84], lowered-opcode vs C-builtin agreement for `dispatch` and the
  bench-only buffer builtins).
- **CI**: new `extensions` job builds `make http` and runs the suite
  against it (the probe-gated HTTP/model sections never executed in CI
  before), compile-checks `make gfx` and the LSP, and runs
  `make jit-smoke`.
- **`make lsp` fixed**: the hand-picked source list predated the
  bytecode VM (80 unresolved symbols); it now links the full runtime
  minus `main.c`, with the missing `g_exe_dir` / `g_load_env`
  definitions added to `eigenlsp.c`.
- `make_fn` dropped its dead `body`/`body_count` params (AST bodies
  died with the tree-walking evaluator); `clone_ast` survives as the
  parser-internal compound-dot-assign desugar helper.

Round 2 (residual gaps from `docs/TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md`):

- **`make fuzz` fixed** — same bitrot as the LSP: FUZZ_SOURCES predated
  the bytecode VM and the harness called the deleted `eval_node`. It
  now links the full runtime minus main.c and drives tokenize → parse
  → compile_ast → vm_execute; 44 curated adversarial cases run under
  ASan in the `extensions` CI job on every push.
- **ext_db executes in CI** — new `database` job: postgres:16 service
  container, `make full`, suite with `DATABASE_URL`. `test_db.eigs`
  gained a live-connection-gated table round-trip (DB09–DB15:
  CREATE / parameterized INSERT / COUNT / parameterized SELECT /
  multi-row `db_query_json` / malformed-SQL error).
- **New suites/checks**: `test_corpus.eigs` ([86], 25 checks —
  `build_corpus` + the `tok_base_string` detokenizer table, both 0%
  before; lexer.c 71→92%), ext_store list-valued fields +
  corrupt-header rejects (`store_json_parse_array` was 0%;
  test_store 14→22), JSON escape branches JH32–JH43 (`\n \r \t \/ \`
  + multi-byte `\uXXXX`, only ASCII `\u` ran before), lint
  fn-def-shadow / fn-unreachable / feature-rich-clean-walk
  (lint.c 50→81%), and hot interrogated/captured-name assignment in
  `test_jit_paths.eigs` (`jit_helper_set_fn_name_local`, the last 0%
  JIT helper, → 69%).
- Findings for future cleanup: the lint empty-block and
  is-in-condition rules are unreachable (parser rejects those inputs
  first), and eigenscript.c's residual ~25% is mostly `tok_type_name`
  plus legacy env API variants the VM no longer calls.
- Suite: 1704 checks (release + ASan; 27 tallied closure-cycle
  leak-exits), 1766 on the full build with live postgres.

### Fixes

- **#159 — `proc_read_buf` for binary-safe child stdout; `proc_read_line`
  / `proc_write` return partials instead of dropping them.** Three
  related robustness fixes in the 0.13.0 streaming-subprocess surface:
  - `proc_read` reads into a heap buffer, writes a trailing NUL, and
    returns a `VAL_STR` — an embedded NUL in the child's output
    silently truncated the result at the first one. The natural use
    of `proc_read` (as opposed to `_line`) is bulk/binary output,
    where NUL is just a byte. New `proc_read_buf of [fd, max]`
    mirrors `read_bytes_buf`: returns a `VAL_BUFFER` so every byte
    survives, indexable like any buffer; `null` on EOF; same 10 MB
    cap. `proc_read` is now documented as text-only.
  - `proc_read_line` returned `null` when a mid-stream `read(2)`
    failed, dropping any partial line already buffered. The
    documented contract reserves `null` for "EOF with empty buffer";
    a partial-then-error now returns the partial (mirrors the
    EOF-with-partial path just below).
  - `proc_write` returned `-1` after a **partial** write hit an error
    (e.g. EPIPE mid-stream). Within the contract, but a caller that
    retries on `-1` then double-sends the delivered prefix. Now
    returns the partial byte count; `-1` is reserved for the
    nothing-was-written case (like `write(2)` itself).
  Regression in `tests/test_proc_stream.eigs` (30 → 39 checks):
  `printf %b` with an embedded `\0` round-trips through
  `proc_read_buf` byte-for-byte (15a–15f), `proc_read` still
  NUL-truncates (16a), and `proc_read_buf` returns `null` on EOF
  (17a, 17b).
- **#158 — defaults fire for every unsupplied defaulted slot, regardless
  of `argc`.** The OP_CALL binding logic in `src/vm.c` gated the
  null-placeholder bind-then-OP_DEFAULT_PARAM tail on `(argc >=
  first_default) && (argc < param_count)`. That meant an underfed call
  *below* `first_default` skipped the entire defaulted tail — on
  `define f(a, b, c is 1)`, `f of 5` bound `a=5, b=null, c=null`
  instead of `a=5, b=null, c=1`. The DISPATCH path (single-arg method
  call) had the analog: the `first_default <= 1` gate left slot 1+
  unbound whenever `first_default > 1`. Fix: drop the lower-bound `argc
  >= first_default` requirement at both `src/vm.c` binding sites and
  the OP_DISPATCH path. Tail slots `[argc, param_count)` always get a
  null placeholder when the chunk has defaults; OP_DEFAULT_PARAM then
  fills the defaulted ones (non-defaulted underfed slots stay null,
  matching the no-default underfed semantics). The #154 contract
  callout that documented the now-fixed argc<first_default subtlety is
  rewritten — the docs and behavior now agree. Regression in
  `tests/test_default_params.eigs` (+7 checks 9a–9g: underfed-mid,
  underfed-empty, two-default-trailing combinations) and
  `tests/test_call_semantics.eigs` (the `mpd2 of []` shape flipped to
  `[null, 100]`; added `mpd3` underfed scalar/empty checks).
- **#157 — destructure pattern parser: specific errors, no silent fallthrough.**
  The 0.13.0 destructuring lookahead in `src/parser.c` filled a fixed
  `names_tmp[64]` buffer and silently `p->pos = saved`-restored the
  position on any mismatch (>64 names, trailing comma, non-ident
  target). The user then hit whatever the list-literal expression
  parser said about the same tokens — usually "1 parse error(s)" with
  no hint that they'd written something close to a destructure.
  Fix: before consuming, bracket-count the lookahead to find the
  matching `]` and check if the following token is `is`. If so, commit
  to destructure parsing and emit pattern-specific errors:
  - `[a, b,] is rhs` → "trailing comma in destructuring pattern"
  - `[a[0], b] is rhs` / `[a.x, b] is rhs` → "destructuring pattern
    requires identifiers (index/field targets like a[0] or a.x are not
    supported)"
  - 65+ name pattern → "destructuring pattern exceeds 64 names"
  List-literal expression statements that don't end in `] is` still
  parse normally (the scan returns "not a destructure"). Regression in
  `tests/run_all_tests.sh` (slot [16/16] Error Messages, +3 checks
  EM21/EM22/EM23).
- **#154 — docs: unflagged semantic change `g of []` on multi-param fn.**
  0.13.0's default-params commit lowered `f of []` to an argc=0 call
  so an all-default function can be called with no args. The single-
  param non-defaulted case was preserved by a compile-time special
  case (`one of []` still binds the param to the empty list), but
  multi-param functions silently changed: `g of []` on
  `define g(a, b)` now binds `a=null, b=null` (was `a=[], b=null` in
  0.12.0). The new behavior is the cleaner reading of the contract
  ("missing parameters are `null`"), but it's still an observable
  shift that wasn't flagged. Fix: LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md default-params
  section now spells out the change, including the subtle case that
  defaulted multi-param fns *also* get all-null (because defaults fire
  only when `argc >= first_default`, and argc=0 < 1 = first_default).
  A grep of the suite and Tidepool turned up no multi-param-takes-
  empty-list call sites, so no code change needed. Regression in
  `tests/test_call_semantics.eigs` (12 → 16): pin down the multi-param
  `[null, null]` shape, the 1-param-preserves-empty-list shape, the
  defaulted-1-param fires its default, and the defaulted-multi-param
  all-null (argc<first_default) edge.
- **#153 — docs: contract spells out the `f of [x]` non-spread rule.**
  `docs/LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md` previously promised "if `f` has two or
  more parameters and `X` is a list, the elements are spread", which
  read like a length-agnostic rule. The compiler only spreads literal
  lists at `count > 1` (`src/compiler.c` call lowering), so `f of [x]`
  always binds the one-element list as a single argument regardless of
  callee arity. With 0.13.0 default parameters, "call a defaulted
  multi-param fn with one arg" became a mainstream pattern and started
  hitting this surprise — notably the recursive form `fib of [n - 1]`
  the moment you add a defaulted `memo`. Fix: the call-spread section
  now states "literal list of length ≥ 2 spreads; length-1 binds the
  whole list", and the default-params section calls out the footgun
  with the `fib` example and the `f of (x)` paren-form workaround.
  Behavior unchanged; this is a docs-only sharpening. Regression in
  `tests/test_call_semantics.eigs` (8 → 12 checks): pin down the
  multi-param + 1-elem-list, paren-form spread, default-fires-with-paren,
  and `fib of (n - 1)` recursion shape.
- **#152 — `audio_play_loop` hard caps loops + clip-aware byte budget.**
  `builtin_audio_play_loop` cast its `double` loops argument to `int`
  without bounds-checking; NaN, `+inf`, or any value above `INT_MAX` was
  undefined behavior, and even a well-formed huge `int` (or a modest
  count over a multi-second clip) would queue gigabytes into SDL's audio
  ring in a single call. `SDL_QueueAudio` copies the buffer each time,
  so one bad call could OOM the process or stall it in a copy loop. Fix:
  reject NaN and any value outside `[1, 10000]` before the cast (hard
  ceiling, documented in CLAUDE.md), and additionally reject any call
  whose total queued bytes would exceed a 256 MiB budget
  (`loops * samples * sizeof(int16_t)`). A 5-second 44100Hz clip caps
  at ~593 loops; the typical short-clip case (a few hundred ms) still
  hits the 10000-loop ceiling. Regression in `tests/test_audio.eigs`
  (slot [62], 20 → 24): covers `loops>10000`, `1e20` (cast UB sentinel),
  byte-budget rejection on a 5s clip, and `loops=10000` at the ceiling
  still succeeding.
- **#151 — `recv_timeout` clamps `ms` before the `(long)` cast.**
  `builtin_recv_timeout` cast a `double` ms argument directly to `long`
  when computing the deadline; NaN, `+inf`, or any value above `LONG_MAX`
  is undefined behavior in C and in practice produced a garbage deadline
  that fired immediately (spurious instant timeout) or waited
  essentially forever. Fix: sanitize `ms` first — NaN degenerates to 0
  (try_recv), negatives degenerate to 0, anything above ~one year of
  ms (3.15e10) clamps to that ceiling, which keeps the integer
  arithmetic well below `LONG_MAX` on every supported `time_t`.
  Related hardening: channel condvars now use `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` via
  `pthread_condattr_setclock`, so `recv_timeout`'s deadline is immune
  to wall-clock steps (NTP, `settimeofday`). Matches `exec_capture`'s
  monotonic discipline. Regression in `tests/test_channel_nb.eigs`
  (slot [77], 22 → 29).
- **#148 — replay boundary for subprocess and concurrency builtins.**
  Ten builtins sit on the wrong side of `EIGS_REPLAY`'s replay-by-tape
  contract: `proc_spawn`, `proc_write`, `proc_read_line`, `proc_read`,
  `proc_close`, `proc_wait`, `exec_capture`, `recv`, `try_recv`,
  `recv_timeout`. Their return values do not pin down the host-side
  causal structure (child PIDs, fd numbers, kernel scheduling), so
  replaying them — even with `TRACE_NONDET_TAKE` — would let a recorded
  script re-execute real side effects against a tape that cannot
  re-create the world it ran in (verified: replaying a proc program
  forked real children). Fix: each of the ten builtins now checks
  `g_replay_enabled` first and raises a catchable runtime error
  (`"<fn>: not replayable under EIGS_REPLAY (subprocess/concurrency
  boundary; see docs/TRACE.md)"`). Boundary is documented in a new
  "Non-Replayable Builtins" section of `docs/TRACE.md`. Regression in
  `tests/test_replay.sh` (two new cases).
- **#149 — `FD_CLOEXEC` on `proc_spawn` and `exec_capture` pipe fds.**
  The four pipe ends in `proc_spawn` (`in_pipe[0/1]`, `out_pipe[0/1]`)
  and the two in `exec_capture` (`pipefd[0/1]`) were left without
  `FD_CLOEXEC` after `pipe(2)`, so a subsequent `proc_spawn` /
  `exec_capture` child inherited the parent-side fds of every prior
  spawn — a long-running interpreter accumulating live procs would leak
  growing fd tables into each new child. Fix: `fcntl(F_SETFD,
  FD_CLOEXEC)` on every pipe end right after `pipe()`. The child's
  `dup2` into `STDIN_FILENO`/`STDOUT_FILENO` clears `FD_CLOEXEC` on the
  destination, so the child's own stdio still survives `execvp`.
  Regression in `tests/test_proc_stream.eigs` (case 13: spawn cat, then
  `exec_capture` a `sh -c` checker that asserts the pipe fds are absent
  from the new child's `/proc/self/fd`).
- **#150 — `exec_capture` child resets `SIGPIPE` to `SIG_DFL`.**
  `proc_spawn` installs a process-wide `SIGPIPE = SIG_IGN` once (so
  the EigenScript parent gets `EPIPE` on write instead of dying), and
  that disposition survives `fork`. After at least one `proc_spawn`,
  every `exec_capture` child inherits `SIG_IGN`, so any subprocess
  pipeline that relies on `SIGPIPE` to drain (`yes | head -1`,
  `cat | head`, GNU `tar | cmd`) hangs — the upstream producer fills
  its pipe buffer instead of dying when the downstream reader exits.
  Fix: `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_DFL)` in the `exec_capture` child block
  between `fork` and `execvp`, mirroring `proc_spawn`. Regression in
  `tests/test_proc_stream.eigs` (case 14: `yes | head -n 1` under
  `exec_capture` with a 5s timeout — passes promptly when SIGPIPE is
  reset, would hit the timeout otherwise).
- **#155 — `frame->call_argc` initialized on `vm_run`'s base frame.**
  Every entry path that runs a user function through `vm_execute`
  (`spawn`, `sort_by` / tensor gradient callbacks via `call_eigs_fn`,
  `dispatch`, HTTP handlers, module-level) leaves the base frame's
  `call_argc` reading whatever stale value the last occupant of that
  depth left behind — or zero on a fresh thread. `OP_DEFAULT_PARAM`
  compared against that garbage, so a 0.13.0 default could fire over
  a slot the caller did supply. Most reproducible on a fresh thread:
  `spawn of [worker(a, b is 100), 1, 2]` was returning 101 instead of
  3. Fix: set `frame->call_argc = chunk->param_count` in the base-frame
  init — the C caller has already bound every param, so no default
  should re-fire. Regression in `tests/test_default_params.eigs`
  (slot [72], 16 → 21).
- **#156 — AST pre-pass walkers handle `AST_SLICE` and
  `AST_LIST_PATTERN_ASSIGN`.** All five compiler walkers
  (`collect_referenced_names`, `collect_referenced_names_skip`,
  `scan_for_captures`, `scan_for_interrogated`,
  `collect_module_names_walk`) fell through `default: break` on the
  two 0.13.0 node types, so a closure that touched an outer local
  only through a slice (`data[1:3]`) or a destructure RHS
  (`[m, n] is pair`) slot-promoted the outer and read `null`, and a
  module-level destructure (`[gx, gy] is [100, 200]`) was invisible
  to module-name collection so writes inside functions silently
  created locals instead of updating the globals. Fix: register
  destructure target names and recurse into RHS / slice
  (target, start, end) in every walker. Regressions in
  `tests/test_slicing.eigs` (slot [76], 46 → 48) and
  `tests/test_destructuring.eigs` (slot [74], 26 → 28).

### Audio — `audio_play_loop` (finite-count loop playback)

`audio_play_loop of [samples, loops]` queues a sample list `loops`
times in a single call (finite, `loops >= 1`). Saves N round-trips
through the workaround pattern of polling `audio_queue_size` each
frame to refill an ambient loop. Returns total samples queued
(`len of samples * loops`), or `0` on bad args / closed device.

`loops == -1` (continuous infinite loop) is intentionally rejected
for now — that needs a background refill mechanism and is a
separate ship. The proper way to choose between the two: pick
`audio_play_loop` for any finite repetition (game ambient that
plays N times, sound cue repeated, music loop that ends with the
level); pick the existing poll-and-refill workaround for genuinely
infinite cases until the infinite variant lands.

Wire-up: new `builtin_audio_play_loop` in `src/ext_gfx.c` next to
`builtin_audio_play`, registered alongside it. Single int16
conversion pass, then N `SDL_QueueAudio` calls with the same
buffer — keeps memory flat regardless of `loops` count (vs. a
single-call `n * loops` allocation that would balloon for long
clips).

Test: 6 new checks appended to `tests/test_audio.eigs` (suite slot
[62], 14 → 20), gated on a successful `audio_open` so the
non-gfx builds and headless-CI machines fall through to skip-asserts.
SDL2's `dummy` audio driver is enough to exercise the success path
locally (`SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy`). Closes Tidepool `GAPS.md`
GAP-002 finite-count form.

Note also: GAP-001 (`audio_sweep`) was already shipped (predates
this cycle); Tidepool's GAPS.md just hadn't been updated.

### Language — `spawn` with multiple args

`spawn of [fn, arg1, arg2, ...]` now passes N positional arguments
to the spawned function, not just one. Bare `spawn of fn` (no args)
and the existing `spawn of [fn, arg]` (one arg) keep working
verbatim. Missing trailing params bind to `null`; extra args are
ignored — same arity-tolerant stance EigenScript already uses for
regular calls. Args are shared by reference, not deep-copied,
matching the channel model already in place (`docs/BUILTINS.md`
thread-safety note: mutable containers shouldn't be mutated
concurrently from both sides; transfer ownership or send immutable
values).

Wire-up: `ThreadHandle` swaps its single `fn_arg: Value*` slot for
`fn_args: Value**` + `fn_arg_count: int`; `builtin_spawn` incref's
every list element 1..N (element 0 is the fn) into a heap-allocated
arg array; `thread_entry` binds `args[0..bind_n)` to params via
`env_set_local`, then fills the remaining params with `null` via
`env_set_local_owned`; `builtin_thread_join` decref's every arg
and frees the array on cleanup. For `VAL_BUILTIN` callees the
1-arg path stays `fn(args[0])` (zero churn for existing one-shots
like `spawn of [my_builtin, x]`); 0-arg becomes `fn(null)`; N-arg
packs into a list to match how EigenScript surfaces multi-arg
calls to builtins everywhere else.

Test: `tests/test_spawn_args.eigs` (22 checks across 0/1/2/3-arg
forms, underfill / overfill, heterogeneous types, concurrent
spawns with no cross-talk, shared-by-ref semantics, closure capture
+ extra args, and the non-function-first-arg error path; suite slot
[78]). Fix for Tidepool `GAPS.md` GAP-006.

### Language — non-blocking channel recv (`recv_timeout`)

`recv_timeout of [channel, ms]` joins `try_recv` as the second
non-blocking option for game loops, UI threads, and any caller that
can't afford `recv`'s unbounded park. Returns the value if one
arrives — or is already buffered — before the deadline; returns
`null` on timeout or on close-while-waiting. Fractional `ms` is
honored (ns precision via `pthread_cond_timedwait` on
`CLOCK_REALTIME`); negative `ms` degenerates to a `try_recv`.

Wire-up: new `builtin_recv_timeout` in `src/builtins.c` next to
`builtin_recv` / `builtin_try_recv`, registered alongside them in the
builtins env. Deadline is computed by adding `ms` to a
`clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, ...)` snapshot, then the existing
`while (count == 0 && !closed && rc == 0)` drain pattern uses
`pthread_cond_timedwait` instead of `pthread_cond_wait` — so it
honors spurious wakeups, close broadcasts (channel's
`pthread_cond_broadcast(&not_empty)` already wakes the waiter), and
the deadline uniformly. No new state on the `Channel` struct.

`try_recv` was already shipped earlier but had zero suite coverage;
the new `tests/test_channel_nb.eigs` closes that hole alongside the
`recv_timeout` paths (22 checks across empty / buffered / FIFO /
post-close drain / negative-ms degeneration / cross-thread arrival /
close-while-waiting / error paths; suite slot [77]). Fix for
Tidepool `GAPS.md` GAP-005.

### Language — slicing

`a[start:end]` is now a real expression form, half-open, with `[:]`,
`[start:]`, `[:end]`, and `[:]` defaults and negative bounds resolved
against length first. Applies to lists, strings, and buffers — the
same three sequence types that accept `a[i]`. The slice is always an
**independent copy**: mutating `b = a[1:4]; b[0] is 999` leaves `a`
untouched, matching the same "values, not views" stance used by the
rest of the language.

Bounds-check is strict, not clamping: `0 <= start <= end <= len`
(note `<=` on the upper end, since positions sit between elements —
`a[len:]` is a legal empty slice but `a[len]` raises). Too-positive
upper bounds, inverted ranges (`a[3:1]`), too-negative starts
(`a[-99:]`), and non-integer / non-sequence operands all raise, same
philosophy as single indexing — same surfacing of sloppy arithmetic
that 0.13.0 already does for `a[2.9999998]`.

Wire-up: new AST node `AST_SLICE { target, start, end }` (NULL bound
= omitted = default), new opcode `OP_SLICE_GET` (pops 3, pushes 1).
Parser factors a `parse_subscript_suffix` helper out of the seven
inline `[...]` postfix sites in `parser.c` so list-vs-slice
disambiguation happens in one place; statement-level destructuring
(`[a, b] is rhs`) is unaffected because that lookahead runs only
when `[` opens a fresh statement. JIT scanner needs no change — its
default-else stops on any unknown opcode, so a new bytecode just
falls back to the interpreter for now. Test:
`tests/test_slicing.eigs` (46 checks across 18 sections, suite slot
[76]).

### Language — streaming subprocess I/O

Six new builtins for talking to a child process over time, sibling to
`exec_capture`'s all-at-once form. `proc_spawn of [argv...]` returns
`[pid, in_fd, out_fd]` (or `[-1,-1,-1]` on failure) for a fork+execvp
child with stdin/stdout connected to anonymous pipes; `proc_write`,
`proc_read_line`, and `proc_read` move bytes through those pipes with
raw `read(2)`/`write(2)` (no parent-side stdio buffering — line
streaming relies on the child not block-buffering its stdout, hence
the `stdbuf -oL` note in the contract); `proc_close` is an idempotent
`close(2)`; `proc_wait` blocks on `waitpid` and returns the exit code
(or `128+sig` if killed by a signal).

SIGPIPE is set to `SIG_IGN` process-wide on first spawn so a writing
parent gets `EPIPE` from `proc_write` instead of dying; the child
resets SIGPIPE to `SIG_DFL` post-fork so it keeps conventional Unix
broken-pipe semantics. No GC integration on the handle for v1:
callers explicitly `proc_close` both fds and `proc_wait` the pid.
Test: `tests/test_proc_stream.eigs` (25 checks, suite slot [75]).

### Language — destructuring assignment

`[a, b, c] is rhs` evaluates `rhs` once, requires it to be a list of
exactly 3 elements, and binds the three names. Length mismatch and
non-list RHS both raise; matches the strict bounds-check stance the
language already uses for indexing. Swap is the natural consequence:
`[a, b] is [b, a]` builds the RHS list first, so both reads happen
before either write.

Wire-up: AST `AST_LIST_PATTERN_ASSIGN { names[], name_hashes[],
expr }`; new opcode `OP_DESTRUCTURE_UNPACK <n:u16>` that pops a list,
validates length, then pushes elements in reverse so element 0 ends
up at TOS. Compiler factors the per-name OBSERVE+SET emission out of
AST_ASSIGN into a reusable `emit_assign_for_tos` helper (same slot/
captured/global resolution rules) and the destructure case calls it
N times with `OP_POP` between each to expose the next element.
Parser recognises `[ IDENT (, IDENT)* ] is` at statement start via
lookahead with save/restore, so list-literal expressions still parse
as expressions. V1 supports plain identifier targets only — nested
patterns, index/field targets, and rest patterns are deliberately
deferred. Test: `tests/test_destructuring.eigs` (26 checks, suite
slot [74]).

### Language — negative indexing

`a[-1]` is now the last element of `a`, `a[-2]` the second-to-last,
through `a[-len of a]` which is the first. Applies uniformly to
lists, strings, and buffers (the three sequence types `a[i]` accepts
today). Resolution is `i + len` *before* the bounds check, so the
valid input range becomes `[-len, len)`; too-negative indices raise
the same out-of-range error as too-positive ones. Error messages
report the original user-written index (`a[-99]` on len 5 raises
"index -99 out of range" — not the post-resolution value).

Wire-up: new `vm_index_resolve(&i, len)` helper in vm.c sits between
`vm_index_is_int` and the bounds check; all 14 index sites
(OP_INDEX_GET / OP_INDEX_SET / jit_helper_index_get /
jit_helper_index_set, slot fast paths and slow paths, list+string+
buffer arms) route through it. JIT inline INDEX_SET buffer fast path
needs no change: its unsigned-compare bounds-check already bails to
the helper on negative indices, and the helper now resolves them.
Test: `tests/test_negative_index.eigs` (19 checks including
JIT-loop coverage, suite slot [73]).

### Language — default parameter values

`define f(a, b is expr) as: ...` — trailing parameters can carry
default expressions. When the caller omits an argument the default
is evaluated *at call time* against the live environment + the
already-bound earlier parameters, so defaults can reference earlier
params (`define pair(a, b is a * 2)`) and capture an outer name
freshly per call (`define scale(x, k is multiplier)` re-reads
`multiplier`). Defaults are trailing-only — a required parameter
after a defaulted one is a parse error.

Explicit `null` is a real argument and **does not** trigger the
default. To call with zero args on a single-parameter function,
pass the empty list literal: `f of []` lowers to an argc=0 call.
Lambdas (`->` arrows, `lambda` blocks) do not accept defaults.

Wire-up: AST `func` gains `param_defaults[]` + `first_default`;
`EigsChunk` gains `first_default`; new opcode
`OP_DEFAULT_PARAM [slot:16][skip_off:16]` runs at function entry
and jumps over the per-slot default-eval prologue when
`frame->call_argc > slot`. The interpreter and the JIT helper-call
path bind null placeholders for `[argc..param_count)` so the
default prologue is reachable. Per-chunk env recycling is
unaffected — its `argc < param_count` reject already routes
defaulted calls through `env_new`. Test:
`tests/test_default_params.eigs` (16 checks, wired as suite slot
[72]).

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-10

A JIT performance release. Stage 5 (a–i) lands the inline fast-path
matrix — INDEX_SET, EnvIC name get/set, dict-dot via 2-way inline
cache, tracked-num arith/compare operands, native VAL_FN calls inside
thunks, per-loop OSR slots, DOT_SET in-place writes, and per-chunk
call-env recycling. Stage 4v/4w/4x close the bailout coverage chain so
INDEX_SET, LOOP_STALL_CHECK, and SET-name opcodes all compile into
thunks. Compile-gating the temporal history removes the always-on
reversibility tax from non-temporal programs. Cumulative on
bench_dmg_shape: 239 → ~116 ms (2.06×); the JIT now beats
`EIGS_JIT_OFF` by ~45% on it, and cpu_instrs runs at ~5 MHz (target
was 4.19).

### Performance — Stage 5i: per-chunk call-env recycling

A function chunk's env layout is fixed (same param names → same slots
→ same hashes), so a dead call env can be parked on its chunk and the
next call rebinds the param slots in place — no env_new, no per-param
env_hash_insert, no binding_version bump, which also keeps every EnvIC
aimed at the env valid across calls. On bench_dmg_shape, env_new
dropped 500k → 9 per run.

Park gates (any failure falls back to env_free, which keeps its own
freelist): single-threaded only (chunks are shared across spawn
threads); never a loop-scope child env (frame->env must equal
fn_env); not captured by a closure; count must equal the
compiler-known layout — a binding created mid-call (e.g. a new
SET_NAME_LOCAL name, `__loop_exit__`) must NOT resolve in the next
invocation, and an underfed call leaves params unhashed; every param
slot must be name-bound (a single-arg OP_DISPATCH to a multi-param fn
binds only param 0). Take gates: cache parent matches the callee's
closure env and the call fully binds the params. Parked slots are
dropped to null (no value pinning) with assign_counts cleared.

Numbers: 2M-trivial-call probe 147 → 109 ms (−26%), recursive fib(25)
23.5 → 19.4 ms (−17%), bench_dmg_shape ~118 → ~116 ms (small — the
per-call env work was a thin time slice there despite dominating the
call counts). All four return paths (interpreter RETURN/RETURN_NULL,
jit_helper_return/_null) park; all three call sites (CASE(CALL),
jit_helper_call, CASE(DISPATCH)) take.

### Performance — Stage 5h: DOT_SET immediate fast path + 2-way dict cache

bench_dmg_shape 156 → ~118 ms (−24%); cumulative for the 0.12.0 JIT
work, 239 → 118 ms (2.0×). Both fixes came straight out of the
post-5f/5g profile and help the interpreter as well as the JIT
(EIGS_JIT_OFF dmg: 230 → 213 ms):

- **DOT_SET immediate fast path.** `jit_helper_dot_set` and
  CASE(DOT_SET) now take the `dict_set_cached_immediate` route that
  LOCAL_DOT_SET has had since 0.11: an immediate-num write into an
  exclusive untracked num field mutates `data.num` in place. The old
  path materialized every value through `vm_pop` — 2 `make_num` +
  ~1.5 `free_value` per DMG step on `ctx.cycles is …` / `ctx.pc is …`
  (999k of the profile's 1.0M make_num calls).
- **2-way set-associative dict cache** (64 sets × 2 ways; same 128
  entries). Direct mapping had a pathological mode the DMG register
  file hit dead-on: two hot keys on the SAME dict whose hashes collide
  mod the set count ("pc"/"cycles") evicted each other on every
  access — 500k full hash walks per run through the dot_get helpers.
  Insertion shifts the previous insert to way 0, so an alternating
  pair settles with one key per way; the Stage 5d inline probe checks
  both ways (no swapping) so a settled pair stays settled in native
  code too.

### Performance — JIT Stage 5f/5g: native calls + per-loop OSR slots

bench_dmg_shape 212 → ~156 ms (−27%); the JIT now beats the
interpreter by ~33% on this workload where they were previously near
parity. Two structural fixes and one coverage op:

- **5g — per-loop OSR slots.** Diagnosis: a chunk had ONE OSR slot,
  owned forever by whichever loop crossed the back-edge threshold
  first. bench_dmg_shape's 65k-iteration setup loop pinned it, so the
  500k-iteration main loop ran fully interpreted through every prior
  stage. Chunks now carry `jit_osr[4]` — one slot per hot loop header,
  scanned by the JUMP_BACK handler; failed offsets keep their slot so
  they can't retry-storm.
- **5f — native VAL_FN calls inside thunks.** `jit_helper_call` now
  pushes the callee frame and invokes the callee's own thunk directly
  when one exists, so a fully-native callee (RETURN sentinel) returns
  straight into the caller's thunk — the DMG shape `cyc is handler of
  ctx` no longer forces an interpreted tail every iteration.
  Return-code triage: 0 = completed; 1 = not eligible (uncompiled
  callee / non-callable / frame or native-depth cap — interpreter
  re-executes the CALL untouched); 2 = deep bail — the callee's thunk
  exited mid-prefix (guard bail, nested deep bail, or pending error),
  every frame ip is left consistent, and a new `-2` advance sentinel
  tells vm_run's three thunk sites to resync to the current frame and
  interpret on. Native call depth is capped (64) because each nested
  native call recurses the C stack, unlike the interpreter's flat
  frame array; errors inside a native callee force a prompt deep bail
  so CHECK_ERROR unwinds without running arbitrary native caller code.
- **OP_DOT_SET compiles into thunks** (helper running CASE(DOT_SET)
  verbatim) — it was the last unsupported op in the DMG main loop
  (`ctx.cycles is …` on a GET_NAME'd dict).

### Performance — JIT Stage 5e: tracked-num operands in arith/compare

Fixes the "observed counter permanently bails native code" class found
in 5d validation, with the mechanism now precisely diagnosed: it is
CASE(SET_LOCAL)'s in-place branch — a counter assigned once while
observed (`k is 0` before an `unobserved:` block) becomes a tracked
Value, and every later unobserved `SET_LOCAL` of an immediate mutates
that Value in place, so the env slot stays a tracked pointer forever
and every native arith/compare touching it bailed, every iteration.

- ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV/MOD and all six comparisons now accept heap/tracked
  `VAL_NUM` operands via a shared loader: immediate → as before;
  pointer → tag/type guards, `refcount >= 2` (rc==1 routes to the
  interpreter so its NUM_REUSE in-place branch keeps observer-value
  identity exact), then `data.num` through the pointer.
- Operand stack refs drop at commit: a's slot is captured before the
  result store overwrites it; b's slot memory sits just above the new
  TOS. A branched commit on the OR of both operands' tag bits
  (snapshotted in %r8 before the loaders) keeps the imm/imm path at
  its pre-5e two-instruction cost (~3% residual on pure-immediate
  loops from the snapshot+test, traded for the class win).
- Per-op bail trampolines: each template's many guards share one
  rel32 hop to the epilogue, so the 256-slot patch budget now scales
  to arbitrarily arith-dense chunks.
- The JIT SET_LOCAL template now mirrors the interpreter's in-place
  branch exactly (imm TOS over an exclusive untracked num rewrites
  data.num). This is correctness, not just speed: the swap path would
  free a Value that `g_last_observer` can still point at — the
  interpreter never frees it in this situation precisely because of
  that branch.

Poisoned-counter dict loop 141→105 ms (−26%); bench_idxset 24.6→22.2
ms (−10%, its `fill` counter was poisoned); observed buffer-fill probe
−13%. bench_dmg_shape is now capped by user-fn OP_CALL bails forcing
an interpreted tail every iteration — recorded in ROADMAP.md as the
next JIT item.

### Performance — JIT Stage 5d: inline dict-dot fast paths

`LOCAL_DOT_GET` / `LOCAL_DOT_SET` (the `c.a is c.a + 1` shape — DMG
register access) now inline their hot paths in thunks instead of
paying the helper-call ABI:

- shared probe: fn_env slot is a heap `VAL_DICT`, dict-cache entry
  match (`(h ^ ptr) & mask` with the hash baked at compile time, the
  TLS cache reached via the g_vm tpoff delta), interned-key pointer
  equality;
- GET pushes `v->data.num`'s raw bits when the field is an untracked
  num — that IS the immediate slot encoding, so no refcounts and no
  allocation;
- SET mirrors `dict_set_cached_immediate`: in-place `data.num`
  overwrite when the existing field is an exclusive untracked num and
  TOS is an immediate.

Cache misses, strcmp-equal keys, non-num/observed fields, and non-dict
targets fall back to the Stage 4m/4q-d helpers, which repopulate the
dict cache for the next iteration. New `EigsJitLayout` fields expose
the vm.c-private dict cache (tpoff, entry size/offsets, mask).

Isolated dict-RMW loop (2M iterations, fully unobserved): 65 → 45 ms
(−31%). Suite green, zero JIT bailouts on the benchmarks.

### Found — observer-tracked numbers permanently bail native code

Diagnosed while validating 5d: a variable assigned even once while
observed (e.g. `k is 0` before an `unobserved:` block) is promoted to
a TRACKED-num Value, and the interpreter's NUM_REUSE in-place
arithmetic keeps that same tracked Value alive forever — so every
native arith/compare touching it guard-fails, every iteration. The
thunk enters, bails at the first comparison, and the loop body runs
interpreted. This is the structural cap on `bench_dmg_shape`'s
top-level loop (`steps`, `pc` are tracked) and likely on any
"setup, then hot loop" program. Recorded in ROADMAP.md as the next
JIT item: tracked-num operand support in the arith/compare templates
(read `data.num` through the pointer; the write side must respect
observer semantics).

### Performance — JIT Stage 5: inline fast paths (5a/5b/5c)

The Stage 4 coverage chain left hot loops compiling to single thunks
whose every GET_NAME / SET_NAME / INDEX_SET was an out-of-line helper
call costing roughly what computed-goto dispatch did. Stage 5 emits
the few-instruction fast paths inline and calls the helper only on
guard failure:

- **5a — buffer INDEX_SET**: inline guards (immediate-num index/value,
  heap target, `VAL_BUFFER` type, integral index, bounds) + the
  bounds-checked store, stack commit, and target decref. Any guard
  failure jumps to the existing helper call, which owns all other
  target types and the error paths.
- **5b — GET_NAME / SET name family EnvIC**: the IC entry address is
  baked per call site (the constant pool is final by JIT time); the
  inline path does the starting-env identity + binding-version guards,
  walk-depth 0/1 target resolution, and the slot load+incref (GET) or
  `env_store_slot`-equivalent swap with assign-counts bump (SET).
  Traced assigns (`g_trace_hist`), arena-pointer stores, and IC misses
  route to the helper, which also repopulates the IC. A new `%r15`
  frame-pointer cache (scanner flag `needs_frame_cache`) feeds the
  inline paths; it is pushed twice to preserve the body's
  %rsp ≡ 8 (mod 16) call-alignment invariant.
- **5c — `__loop_iterations__` write cache**: the per-iteration
  `env_set_local` in LOOP_STALL_CHECK (name hash + table walk +
  make_num/decref round-trip, every iteration of every `loop while`)
  now goes through a per-thread (env, binding_version, slot) cache and
  overwrites the immediate-num slot in place, with the same
  assign-counts bump. Semantics unchanged — mid-loop reads see the
  same values — so this also speeds the interpreter.

Numbers (5-run medians): bench_dmg_shape 239→218 ms (−9%),
bench_idxset 29.7→24.6 ms (−17%). Targeted probes isolate the inline
wins: a 2M-iteration module-scope `acc is acc + g` loop runs
191→56 ms (3.4×), a 2M-write unobserved buffer loop 215→77 ms (2.8×).
EIGS_JIT_STOPS stays at zero bailouts on both benchmarks.

Also fixes tests/test_leak_guard.sh, whose standalone ASan build was
missing trace.c and silently skipping since the trace tape landed.

### Performance — JIT coverage: SET name family (Stage 4x)

`SET_NAME`, `SET_NAME_LOCAL`, and `SET_FN_NAME_LOCAL` now compile into
thunks via out-of-line helpers on the GET_NAME ABI (chunk pointer +
name index; interpreter semantics verbatim — trace hook, EnvIC fast
path, resolve/create slow path; no stack effect, no error paths). With
Stage 4v/4w this closes the coverage chain: the fn-local index-write
benchmark compiles to a single thunk with zero bailouts, and
bench_dmg_shape's only remaining bailout is a one-time `DICT` literal.

Honest numbers: flat. Helper-call ABI costs roughly what computed-goto
dispatch did, so coverage alone doesn't move timings — it removes the
structural blocker. The next stage (recorded in ROADMAP.md) is
inlining the EnvIC fast paths into native templates with helper
fallback on IC miss; whole-loop thunks are the prerequisite this
stage delivers.

### Performance — JIT coverage: INDEX_SET + LOOP_STALL_CHECK (Stage 4v/4w)

Driven by the EIGS_JIT_STOPS bailout histogram on the new DMG-shaped
benchmark: INDEX_SET was the only bailout opcode, and LOOP_STALL_CHECK
surfaced next (every observed `while` loop carries one per iteration).
Both now compile into thunks via out-of-line helpers — INDEX_SET on
the INDEX_GET ABI (full opcode semantics in the helper, no bail path),
LOOP_STALL_CHECK on the ITER_NEXT shape (helper returns the exit flag,
emitter conditional-jumps to the exit target). No measurable benchmark
delta on its own: thunks now stop at the name-op family (SET_NAME /
SET_NAME_LOCAL and their inline caches), which is the next stage and
where the accumulated coverage should pay off. jit_smoke gains stubs.

### Performance — temporal history is now compile-gated

Profiling a DMG-shaped dispatch workload (new
`tests/bench_dmg_shape.eigs`, 500k dispatch-table steps) showed the
0.11.7 reversibility machinery running unconditionally: 17.8M
`trace_line` and 2.5M `trace_assign` calls — roughly a third of
runtime — whether or not the program ever asked a temporal question.

- **`g_trace_hist`**: per-assign history recording (prev-table, line
  stamps, tape `A` records) now gates on a compiler-set flag, enabled
  by `prev of`, any `at <expr>` qualifier, a `state_at` reference, or
  an open `EIGS_TRACE` tape. `OP_LINE` stores the current line as a
  plain global write instead of a call. Programs with no temporal
  queries also stop accumulating history memory entirely.
- Measured: dmg-shape 295 → 243 ms (−18%); for-loop 50k −32%;
  while 100k −23%; listcomp 20k −57%; observe 10k −44%.
- Post-fix profile for the 0.12.0 push: ~65% vm_run dispatch, then
  env churn (2.58M `env_free`/run ≈ one per call) and `make_num`
  (2.1M). Recorded in ROADMAP.md.

### Fixed
- **Exit-time segfault when a top-level `unobserved` block promoted
  module slots.** Module chunks carry promoted `local_count` slots
  without a `local_names` array (only fn/lambda chunks build one);
  `chunk_free`'s name loop dereferenced NULL. Latent since the loop
  was written — exposed the moment script chunks became freeable
  (0.11.8 chunk refcounting), and invisible to the suite because the
  crash lands *after* correct output and most checks ignore exit
  codes. New suite check [71] runs a promoting script and asserts
  rc=0.

### Added — temporal interrogatives complete the matrix

- **`where`/`why`/`how ... at <line>`** — the observer-derived
  interrogatives now answer historically. Each assignment's history
  entry stamps an observer snapshot (entropy, dH, last_entropy) taken
  with the same ensure-fresh semantics a live query uses, so
  `why is x at 42` returns exactly what `why is x` would have at that
  moment. Capture is compile-gated (`g_trace_obs_hist`): the compiler
  flips it when it sees such a query, so programs that never ask pay
  nothing and the lazy-entropy optimization is undisturbed. Snapshots
  live in a parallel array keyed off the history index (`obs_start`
  handles capture enabling mid-run via eval/REPL). Regression:
  test_temporal.eigs [70] grows to 23 checks, comparing historical
  answers against live values captured at the time.
- **`EIGS_REPLAY_STRICT=1`** — replay name mismatches become fatal
  (diagnostic + exit 3) instead of warn-and-use-anyway, for harnesses
  where tape/program drift should fail loudly. Default stays lenient.
  Regression: test_replay.sh grows to 6 checks (lenient + strict).

## [0.11.8] — 2026-06-10

A reversibility-hardening + memory-correctness release: `state_at`
gets its Phase 4 snapshot cache, container values replay from tape,
the entire suite runs leak-clean under AddressSanitizer (now enforced
in CI), and bytecode chunks are reference-counted — closing the last
deliberate leak and a REPL use-after-free.

### Added — chunk refcounting

Bytecode chunks now carry a refcount: one creator ref (the
`compile_ast` caller, or the parent chunk's `functions[]` slot for
nested chunks), one per live `VAL_FN` (taken in `OP_CLOSURE`, dropped
in `free_val`), and one per active call frame (so a function whose
last value ref dies mid-call cannot have its code freed under it; the
fn value was already popped and decref'd before frame push). JIT
return thunks write `chunk->jit_advance` *after* `jit_helper_return`
runs, so the popped frame's chunk ref is released in vm_run's post-
thunk sentinel handler rather than the helper. The JIT hotness
registry drops its bare pointer via `jit_unregister_chunk` when a
chunk dies.

Consequences: the script path, REPL, `eval`, `load_file`, and
`import` now free their chunks unconditionally (`import` previously
leaked its module chunk entirely); the REPL/`eval` fn-defining-chunk
retention workaround is gone; atomics gate on `g_vm_multithreaded`
like every other refcount.

### Fixed — memory: the suite now runs leak-clean under ASan

Chased the "intentional don't-free-at-exit baseline" and found it was
hiding real per-call leaks and one use-after-free. Every script the
suite runs — all 1279 checks, all 28 example smokes — now exits with
zero ASan leak reports, and CI's sanitizer job runs with
`detect_leaks=1` so any new leak fails the build.

- **Use-after-free: REPL functions died with their chunk.** The REPL
  freed each line's compiled chunk after execution, but fn values hold
  bare pointers into the chunk's nested function chunks — defining a
  function on one REPL line and calling it on a later line read freed
  memory (release builds survived by luck). Chunks that define
  functions are now intentionally retained (same policy as the script
  path's existing chunk TODO); function-less chunks are freed.
- **Stranded birth refs at every adopting store.** `env_set_local`,
  `list_append`, and `dict_set` all incref internally, so the
  ubiquitous `store(make_value(...))` idiom left every stored fresh
  value at refcount 2 with one owner — unfreeable by any teardown. New
  adopting helpers `env_set_local_owned` / `list_append_owned` /
  `dict_set_owned` consume the birth ref; 245 builtin registrations,
  67 list appends, and 49 dict stores converted. Recurring-leak
  call sites fixed along the way: `json_decode` (whole parse tree,
  per call), `json_path` (root tree, per call), `observe` (report
  string), `sort_by` (key results), `args`, `random_normal` (rows),
  `tensor` element-wise/unary/zeros builders, the `numerical_grad`
  family (probe values double-ref'd, loss results never released,
  zero placeholders overwritten without release), closure param
  temporaries (one strdup'd array per closure creation), per-env
  `assign_counts` (every env teardown), and the REPL's per-line AST
  and result values. `try_parse`/`eval` now free their ASTs.
- **Global env teardown at exit.** `env_free` is refcount-honest and
  no-ops while closures hold the env — at exit that leaked the whole
  global scope (191 builtins minimum) because top-level fns live in
  the env they capture. New `env_destroy_final` breaks the cycle
  reentrancy-safely; main tears down trace → env → arena in that
  order on both the script and REPL paths.
- **Replay no longer performs the live work it discards.** Builtins
  that did real I/O before their tape hook (`read_bytes`,
  `read_bytes_buf`, `read_text`, `random_normal`, `http_post`) ran
  that work under `EIGS_REPLAY` and leaked the abandoned live value —
  `http_post` even issued the real network request. New
  `TRACE_NONDET_TAKE`/`TRACE_NONDET_RECORD` pair consumes the call's
  N record up front (exactly one record per call, ordering contract
  intact) and skips the live path entirely.

### Added
- **Line-floor index for backward temporal queries** (the deferred
  Phase 4 snapshot cache). Each name's assignment history now carries
  a periodic index: the minimum line stamp per 64-entry segment.
  `state_at(line)` and the `at <line>` interrogative qualifier skip
  whole segments whose floor exceeds the query line — the loop-heavy
  worst case (deep histories stamped with the same few lines, i.e. a
  debugger scrubbing the timeline) drops from O(H) to O(H/64 + 64)
  per name. Measured: 200 `state_at` queries against 200 000-entry
  histories went from 58 ms to 1.1 ms (~50×). Overhead is one `int`
  per 64 history entries and an O(1) min-update per assign; if the
  index allocation ever fails the name falls back to the plain linear
  scan. Regression: `tests/test_temporal.eigs` ([70], 18 checks) —
  first suite coverage for `prev of` / `at` / `state_at`, including
  a 300-assign loop history that crosses several index segments.
- **Replay of container values.** `parse_value` in `src/trace.c` rewritten
  as a recursive-descent cursor parser; nondet returns that are lists,
  dicts, or buffers now round-trip through `EIGS_REPLAY` instead of
  falling through to the live source (closes the "containers return null"
  caveat from 0.11.7). Buffer serialization gains a leading `b` so
  `b[1,2,3]` disambiguates from a list `[1,2,3]`. Regression:
  `tests/test_replay.sh` — list (`read_bytes`), buffer (`read_bytes_buf`),
  dict (handcrafted `N` record), and nested list-of-dicts-and-buffer;
  each case mutates the underlying file between record and replay to
  prove the value comes from the tape.

### Documentation
- Documented the 0.11.7 reversibility surface: temporal interrogatives
  (`prev of`, `at`) in SYNTAX.md and GRAMMAR.md, `state_at` in
  BUILTINS.md, and a new docs/TRACE.md covering the `EIGS_TRACE` /
  `EIGS_REPLAY` tape format and replay semantics.
- Folded an orphaned `[Unreleased]` section (between 0.10.0 and 0.9.3.4)
  into the 0.10.0 entry it shipped with.

## [0.11.7] — 2026-06-09

A trace + time-travel release. The interpreter learns to remember its
own past — both at the language level (interrogatives that query prior
state) and at the runtime level (a recordable, replayable tape of every
nondeterministic input). The graphical debugger gains step-back.

### Added — Temporal interrogatives

- **`prev of x`** — value of `x` immediately before its most recent
  assign. Parsed with the `of` connector (vs. `is` for what/who/when),
  encoded as interrogative kind 6. Backed by a process-wide prev-table
  keyed by interned-name pointer (open-addressing, fibonacci-hashed),
  populated on every `OP_GSET`. Cost per assign: one cache line + a
  pointer compare. Works whether or not `EIGS_TRACE` is set — this is
  language surface, not debug-only.
- **`at <expr>` qualifier** — any interrogative can be temporally
  qualified: `what is x at 42`, `prev of x at L`, `when is x at L`,
  `who is x at L`. Walks per-name history (line-stamped, append-only)
  backward to the last assign with line ≤ L. The line operand is a
  full expression; `at` is a soft keyword that falls back to `IDENT`
  outside interrogative position. Lib/example collisions (`prev` as
  a variable in `lib/eigen.eigs`, `examples/invariant_decomposition.eigs`)
  renamed to `prior` to make the keyword unambiguous.

### Added — Execution trace tape

`EIGS_TRACE=<path>` opens a text tape and records three event kinds:

- `L <line>` — source-line events from `OP_LINE` (adjacent duplicates
  with no A/N in between are deduped — the compiler emits per-statement
  LINEs and bare repeats are noise).
- `A <name>=<value>` — name-keyed assignment deltas.
- `N <fn>=<value>` — nondeterministic builtin returns (random,
  monotonic_*, env_get, read_*, random_hex, http_post, …).

Full-fidelity nondet writer: per-record byte budget of 64 KiB, recursive
emission of lists/dicts/buffers, strings escape `\"`, `\`, `\n`, `\r`,
`\xNN`, truncation marker on overflow so partial records remain visually
parseable. Disabled cost is one predicted-not-taken load + branch at each
hook site.

### Added — HTTP nondet capture

The HTTP extension's request/response surface is nondeterministic from
the script's perspective. Wrapped returns in `ext_http.c` for:

- `http_post` (success + 7 error paths)
- `http_request_body`, `http_session_id`, `http_request_headers`
  (TLS-state-or-default returns)

Every call lands on the tape as an `N` record, making HTTP-driven
EigenScript runs reproducible.

### Added — Deterministic replay

`EIGS_REPLAY=<path>` opens a previously-recorded tape and serves the
`N` records to nondet builtins in order. Subsequent runs produce
byte-identical output: same random sequence, same monotonic_ns
timestamps, same HTTP responses. Implementation:

- Streaming reader skips `L` and `A` records, parses the next `N`
  value (num/null/bool/string today; lists/dicts return null so the
  builtin falls back to the live source — future work).
- Tape exhaustion gracefully switches off replay; remaining calls hit
  the real source.
- Name mismatches log a warning and use the recorded value anyway
  (lenient Phase 3.0 policy — strict ordering is the contract, names
  are for human-readable debug).
- `TRACE_NONDET_RET` centralized in `trace.h` so the replay short-circuit
  applies uniformly to every nondet builtin; three duplicate copies in
  `builtins.c`, `builtins_tensor.c`, `ext_http.c` removed.

### Added — `state_at(line)` builtin

Returns a dict of every tracked binding's value at or before `line`.
Walks the prev-table's per-name history with backward linear scan —
the existing history records `(line, value)` on every assign, so no
separate snapshot data structures were needed. Periodic snapshot
caching deferred until the linear scan is a profiled bottleneck.

### Added — Debugger step-back UI

`examples/debugger.eigs` gains F8/F11 history navigation while paused:

- The debug hook captures `(line, env-snapshot)` on every statement.
  Snapshots flatten the meta-circular env chain into a `{name: value}`
  dict (inner shadows outer; fn-shaped values skipped). FIFO-capped
  at 10 000 steps.
- F8 walks the view cursor backward; F11 forward; the cursor snaps
  back to live (-1) at the end or when execution resumes (F5/F9/F10).
- Inspector reads from the snapshot; source view highlights the
  historical line in cool blue (vs. live yellow); status bar switches
  to `History step K/N — line L`. Toolbar gains `Back F8` / `Fwd F11`.
- Trace machinery is not wired in here: it tracks host-VM globals,
  and the meta-circular interpreter has its own env dict. Snapshotting
  in the hook is the layer that actually owns the data.

### Suite

1257/1257 base, 15/15 HTTP, all three build variants (default, http+model,
gfx) green.

## [0.11.6] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed (HTTP server availability + protocol hygiene)

Surfaced by attacking the EigenScript HTTP runtime locally against the
landing site at `eigen-site/`. Code review and the existing test harness
both missed these — the underlying defects were architectural (single
accept loop) or in branches the test suite never exercised (HEAD, bad
versions, oversized headers).

- **Single-threaded accept → trivial slowloris DoS.** `http_serve_blocking`
  ran `handle_request` synchronously on the accept thread, so one client
  that opened a TCP connection and sent a partial header line wedged
  every subsequent request until the per-connection deadline expired.
  200 such connections from one host took the site offline. Accepts now
  hand each connection to a detached pthread; the request-state globals
  (`request_body`, `request_headers`, `session_id`, plus a new HEAD
  body-suppression flag) moved to `__thread` storage so workers don't
  trample each other. Concurrency is capped at 256 active connections;
  past that the listener sheds load with `503 Service Unavailable`
  instead of queueing. Regression: `tests/test_http_server.sh` HS13
  (16 slow conns served + GET still completes in <1.5 s).
- **HEAD requests returned 404.** Only GET routes were registered, so
  `HEAD /` fell through to the not-found path even when `GET /` existed.
  HEAD now reroutes to the GET handler and `send_response` skips the
  body via a TLS suppression flag, so callers get correct headers and
  Content-Length with an empty body. Regression: HS10.
- **HTTP version was unvalidated.** `sscanf` read the third token of the
  request line without checking it, so `GET / HTTP/junk` was served as
  200 OK. Now strictly requires `HTTP/<digit>`; everything else gets a
  400. Regression: HS11.
- **OPTIONS preflight returned 200 with empty body and no Allow header.**
  Any client probing methods got a content-free 200 instead of a proper
  preflight. Now answers 204 No Content with `Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS`
  and mirrors CORS headers when `http_cors` is configured. Regression:
  HS07/HS07b.
- **Negative / oversized Content-Length hung the connection.** The old
  guard `free(reqbuf); close(fd)` silently dropped the request, so the
  client waited until its own timeout (or, with worse luck, until the
  30 s per-connection deadline). Now answers `400 Bad Request` with a
  reason string so misbehaving clients see a real error. Regression:
  HS08.
- **Oversized headers were silently truncated to 200 OK.** When the
  request-buffer ceiling (`max_body + 64 KiB`) was hit *before* finding
  `\r\n\r\n`, the read loop broke out and `sscanf` happily parsed the
  request line from whatever prefix had arrived — so a 17 MiB X-Big
  header value yielded a 200 instead of 431. Now answers `431 Request
  Header Fields Too Large` whenever the buffer caps with `header_end`
  still unset. Regression: HS12.

### Removed (struct hygiene)
- Removed `request_body`, `request_headers`, `session_id` from the
  `Server` struct in `ext_http_internal.h` (and their two zero-inits in
  `main.c`). These fields are now thread-local per the threading fix,
  so the struct slots were dead.

## [0.11.5] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed (memory safety)
- **Per-call leak from compensating incref on builtin returns.** The
  `CASE(CALL) VAL_BUILTIN`, `jit_helper_call`, and `OP_DISPATCH` paths
  unconditionally `val_incref`'d the result of every builtin call to keep
  borrowed pointers (e.g. `coalesce`/`append` returning `arg->items[k]`)
  alive across the subsequent `val_decref(arg)`. The same `+1` also fired
  for builtins that return a *fresh* allocation (`range`, `make_str`,
  `keys`, …), so every such call leaked one `Value` plus its contents.
  `for i in range of 1M` silently retained ~80 MB. Replaced with a
  direct-borrow scan that only incref's when `result` is one of `arg`'s
  top-level items; nested borrows like `get_at` keep their local incref.
  `OP_DISPATCH` additionally had `val_decref(arg)` *before* the incref,
  which was a UAF for direct borrows — reordered to match `CASE(CALL)`.
  Regression: `tests/test_leak_guard.sh` (ASan).
- **Use-after-free on consuming builtins via the direct-borrow scan.**
  The leak fix's borrow scan reads `arg->type` *after* the builtin call,
  but `free_val` is a consuming builtin that decrefs `arg` internally —
  on a refcount-1 argument that left the scan reading freed memory. The
  full-suite ASan/UBSan CI job (which a targeted leak guard couldn't have
  caught — the corruption is invisible without a sanitizer watching)
  surfaced it. Gated the scan and the trailing `val_decref(arg)` on
  `!consumes_arg` at all three call sites (`CASE(CALL)`, `jit_helper_call`,
  `OP_DISPATCH`).

### Added (infrastructure)
- **Cross-platform / cross-compiler CI matrix.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  now runs `build-and-test` across ubuntu-latest+gcc, ubuntu-latest+clang,
  and macos-latest+clang (fail-fast off so one platform's failure doesn't
  hide the others), plus a dedicated `sanitizers` job that builds the
  whole runtime with `-fsanitize=address,undefined` and runs the full
  suite under it. `build.sh` honors `$CC` so the matrix can pick the
  compiler. New `make asan` target for local memory-bug hunting.
- **`tests/test_leak_guard.sh`** — ASan regression guard for the builtin
  ref-protocol leak. Builds a minimal ASan eigenscript, runs `range` /
  `make_str` / `keys` / `append` loops, fails if `make_list`/`make_str`/
  `make_dict` appear in any leak frame or if `append`'s borrowed return
  surfaces a UAF. Skips cleanly when ASan is unavailable. Wired into
  `run_all_tests.sh` (step `[69]`).

### Fixed (portability)
- **Non-x86 builds (notably macOS arm64).** `eigs_jit_get_layout` used
  inline `__asm__("mov %%fs:0, %0" ...)` to read the x86-64 thread
  pointer for TLS-relative JIT encoding. JIT codegen is already gated
  `#if defined(__x86_64__)` in `jit.c`, so the layout probe only matters
  there; on other arches the function body now collapses to a no-op
  rather than failing to assemble.
- **macOS test portability.** `test_file_io.eigs` RT1 stops reading
  `/etc/hostname` (Linux-only path) — it now stages a tmp file with
  `write_text` first, then reads it back. `test_coverage_gaps.eigs` CG12
  accepts `/private/tmp` as well as `/tmp` for the `chdir`+`getcwd`
  check, since macOS routes `/tmp` through a symlink.

### Documentation
- **README / ROADMAP refresh.** Updated stale binary size (`~328K` →
  `~420K`) and test count (`831/832` → `1257`) in README. Bumped
  ROADMAP's "Current version" from `0.11.0` to `0.11.4`; moved
  in-place numeric mutation, dict field inline caching, dispatch
  builtin re-entry elimination, and the DMG 0.5+ MHz target out of
  "Next" into "Completed"; reframed 0.12 around the copy-and-patch
  JIT + NaN-boxing prerequisites.

### Removed (code hygiene)
- **Dead statics in `src/compiler.c`.** `block_has_closure`, `emit_u16`,
  `begin_scope`, `end_scope`, and `root_compiler` were defined but
  never called, generating `-Wunused-function` warnings on every
  build. Removed.

### Security
- **Bounded parser recursion depth (stack-exhaustion guard).** The
  recursive-descent parser had no bound on expression nesting, so deeply
  nested source — e.g. `eval` of untrusted input like `((((…))))` — could
  exhaust the C stack and crash. Added a 256-level cap (shared by nested
  expressions and blocks); over-deep source now produces a parse error
  instead of a crash. (Block nesting was already capped at 64 by the
  lexer's indent limit; this closes the expression side.)
- **Constant-time secret comparison (`secure_equals` builtin).** Added
  `secure_equals of [a, b]`, which compares two strings without
  short-circuiting on the first differing byte, and switched `lib/auth.eigs`
  to use it for password and bearer-token checks so comparison timing can't
  leak how many leading bytes matched. Regression:
  `tests/test_security_hardening.eigs`.
- **Bounded JSON nesting depth (stack-exhaustion DoS fix).** The recursive
  JSON parser (`eigs_json_parse_value` → array/object) had no depth limit,
  so deeply nested input like `[[[[…]]]]` exhausted the C stack and crashed
  the process with SIGSEGV. Reachable by any program that `json_decode`s
  untrusted input — notably an HTTP server decoding a request body — making
  it a remote denial of service. Added a 200-level nesting cap; input past
  it is refused and parsing terminates cleanly instead of crashing. Normal
  documents are unaffected. Regression: `tests/test_json_depth.eigs`.

### Added
- **`docs/LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md`** — the language's semantic promises stated
  explicitly (equality, ordering, coercion, errors, numbers, truthiness,
  scope, evaluation, mutability/aliasing, argument unpacking, the full
  operator-precedence table, and indexing), each with an Enforced/Planned
  status and a link to the test that locks it. A living spec to extend
  before adding features.
- **`tests/test_call_semantics.eigs`** — locks two previously-undocumented
  promises: argument unpacking (≥2 params spread a list; a lone param binds
  the whole argument) and reference aliasing (assignment shares containers,
  does not copy).
- **`tests/test_stem_accuracy.eigs`** — a 123-check known-answer audit of
  the STEM libraries (physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, geometry,
  linalg, calculus, probability, stats, numerics, optimize) against
  textbook values. Every check passes: e.g. `gravitational_force` matches
  the 2019 CODATA G, `normal_pdf(0,0,1)` matches 1/√(2π) to 16 digits,
  `rk4` lands on e, Simpson/trapezoidal/midpoint integration and Newton/
  secant/bisection root-finding all hit their analytic answers.
- **`variance_sample` / `std_dev_sample`** in `lib/stats.eigs` — sample
  variance/standard deviation with Bessel's correction (÷N−1). The
  existing `variance`/`std_dev` remain **population** statistics (÷N); the
  difference is now documented in the source and both forms are tested.

### Changed (behavior change)
- **`==` / `!=` are now structural for collections.** Lists and dicts
  previously compared by reference identity, so `[1,2] == [1,2]` was
  `false`. They now compare by structure (lists element-wise, dicts by
  key/value order-independently, buffers/text-builders by contents);
  numbers/strings/null by value; functions and builtins still by identity;
  mixed types are never equal (no coercion). This also makes `match` work
  on list/dict patterns. See `tests/test_equality.eigs`.
- **Numbers print round-trippably.** `value_to_string` used `%.6g`, which
  truncated every non-integer to 6 significant figures (and any integer
  >= 1e15 to lossy scientific form) — `1/3` printed `0.333333`,
  `0.1 + 0.2` printed `0.3`. It now emits the shortest representation that
  parses back to the same double (15–17 significant digits as needed), so
  `0.1 + 0.2` prints `0.30000000000000004` and `str`/`num` round-trip.
  Exact integers up to 2^53 still print without a decimal point. See
  `tests/test_number_format.eigs`.

### Changed (behavior change), continued
- **Mixed-type ordering now raises instead of silently returning false.**
  `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` previously returned `false` when the operands were
  different types (`"3" < 4` was `false`), masking type confusion. They
  now require both operands to be the same comparable type (number/number
  or string/string) and raise a runtime error otherwise (catchable with
  `try`/`catch`). Equality (`==`/`!=`) is unchanged: it never coerces and
  cross-type compares are simply not-equal, never an error.
- **`+` no longer coerces across types.** It adds two numbers or
  concatenates two strings; a mixed operand (`"n=" + 42`, `7 + "x"`) now
  raises instead of silently stringifying (`"3" + 4` used to be `"34"`).
  Use an f-string — `f"n={count}"` — or `str of` to mix types in text.
  (The old coercion path also truncated numbers via `%.14g`; that's moot
  now.) `of` precedence (`len of xs - 1` parses as `(len of xs) - 1`) is
  documented in docs/SYNTAX.md, not changed — the two natural readings
  conflict, and the current rule matches the common idiom.
- **Builtin argument errors now raise instead of warning and returning
  `null`.** `EigenStore` builtins (`store_open`/`put`/`get`/`delete`/
  `query`/`count`/`update`/`collections`/`drop`/`close`), `json_decode`,
  and `load_file` previously printed an `Error:`/`Type error:` line to
  stderr and returned `null` on bad input, so a misuse silently produced
  `null` and the program continued. They now route through the same
  `runtime_error` channel as the rest of the VM — caught by an enclosing
  `try`, otherwise fatal. Non-error outcomes are unchanged: a `store_get`
  miss still returns `null`, a `store_delete` of a missing key still
  returns `0`. (`runtime_error` is now declared in `eigenscript.h` and
  strips a trailing newline so caught messages are clean.) Remaining
  lenient spots, left for a follow-up: a file-open failure in the stream
  builtins, and the optional model extension.

### Fixed (behavior change)
- **Uncaught runtime errors are now fatal and set a non-zero exit code.**
  Previously an uncaught error (undefined variable, index out of range,
  calling a non-function, operator type mismatch, call-stack overflow)
  printed a message, substituted `null`, and execution *continued* — and
  the process still exited `0`. Scripts could fail silently and report
  success, and a stack overflow produced a cascade of follow-on errors
  rather than one. `vm_run` now unwinds to the nearest enclosing `try`
  (across re-entrant calls), or halts the program if there is none, and
  `main` returns `1` when an uncaught error occurred. `try`/`catch`
  behavior is unchanged; caught errors still let the program continue and
  exit `0`. Migration: wrap recoverable operations in `try`/`catch`.
  Note: builtins on the separate "soft" channel (e.g. `store_*` and
  `json_decode`, which print `Error:`/`Type error:` without raising) still
  return `null` and continue — unifying those into the strict model is a
  follow-up.

## [0.11.4] — 2026-05-23

### Performance
- **Intern dict-stored keys + pointer-equality short-circuit in dict
  inline cache**: dict keys were previously `xstrdup`'d at insert, while
  cache callers pass `chunk->const_interns[idx]` (interned strings) —
  pointer equality never matched, so every dict cache hit paid for a
  `strcmp`. Callgrind on the 0.11.3 PGO binary showed `__strcmp_sse2` at
  **4.06%** of retired instructions, dominated by `dict_get_cached` /
  `dict_set_cached` / `dict_set_cached_immediate`. Switched dict-key
  storage to `env_intern_name` (single insert site at
  `eigenscript.c:621`) and added `stored == key || strcmp(...)` to all
  three cache helpers. Hot DMG field accesses now short-circuit on
  pointer equality. DMG `cpu_instrs` (n=10, PGO, `--cycles 200000`)
  went from **1.042 MHz** to **1.094 MHz** mean (+5.0%).

### Build
- Added `make pgo` target: builds an instrumented binary, runs DMG
  cpu_instrs as the default training workload, then rebuilds with
  `-fprofile-use`. ~+8–9% net on the trained workload. `PGO_RUN` and
  `PGO_DIR` overridable for different training workloads.
- Fixed `build.sh` drift: missing `jit.c` in `SOURCES` (broke since the
  VM-layer split) and missing `EIGENSCRIPT_EXT_*` macros in the
  full-build branch.

## [0.11.3] — 2026-05-23

### Performance
- **Gate refcount atomics on `g_vm_multithreaded` flag**: on x86 every
  `__atomic_*_fetch` for refcount work emits a LOCK-prefixed RMW (~20
  cycles each), regardless of memory order. Added a runtime flag,
  default 0, flipped to 1 by `builtin_spawn` before `pthread_create`.
  All `val_incref/decref`, `slot_incref/decref`, and `env_refcount`
  inc/dec/load sites branch on the flag with `__builtin_expect(0)`
  and use plain `++/--` in the single-threaded case. DMG `cpu_instrs`
  (n=10, `--cycles 200000`) went from **0.767 MHz** (0.11.2 baseline)
  to **0.950 MHz** mean (+24%), clearing the Phase B Gate (0.85 MHz)
  with 12% margin.

### Diagnostics
- Per-chunk `jit_stop_op` field + extended `EIGS_JIT_HOT=1` table
  (adv/len/nat%/stop columns + aggregate native-byte share). Surfaces
  the static native-bytecode coverage of JIT-compiled chunks; revealed
  that helper-call prefix extension was hitting diminishing returns
  (~6% native-byte share across all hot chunks).

## [0.11.2] — 2026-05-22

### Bug Fixes
- **`break` in `while` loop corrupted stack**: AST_LOOP patched break
  jumps to land *after* its trailing OP_NULL, so the break path skipped
  the loop's result push while the compile-time tracker (and AST_BREAK's
  +1 phantom) assumed it was there. A statement following the loop then
  popped a stale heap pointer and segfaulted. Patch break jumps before
  OP_NULL so all exit paths agree.
- **`break` in `while` loop freed the global env**: AST_BREAK
  unconditionally emitted OP_LOOP_ENV_END, but only AST_FOR allocates a
  per-iteration env. Breaking out of a `while` therefore released the
  surrounding (often global) env. Track `has_fresh_env` per loop and emit
  OP_LOOP_ENV_END only when set.
- **`local[const]` indexing silently masked errors**: OP_LOCAL_IDX_GET
  (the fused fast path for `arr[i]` on a local slot) returned null on
  out-of-range or wrong-type targets instead of raising runtime_error.
  This made try/catch around errors-inside-functions appear broken
  (error never propagated; function silently returned null). Bring its
  error semantics in line with unfused INDEX_GET.
- **`local[const].field` silently masked errors**: same class of bug in
  OP_LOCAL_IDX_DOT_GET / OP_LOCAL_IDX_DOT_SET. Out-of-range list index
  silently returned null / no-op; non-list non-null targets silently
  failed. Now error like unfused INDEX_GET/INDEX_SET + DOT_GET/SET.
- **64K buffer index truncation**: `idx < (uint16_t)count` truncated
  count to 16 bits — a 65536-byte buffer (e.g. a Game Boy 64K address
  space) reported every index as out-of-range. Compare as int.

### Cleanups
- Drop redundant `slot < (uint16_t)e->count` casts across 7 slot-bounds
  checks in GET_LOCAL / SET_LOCAL / LOCAL_DOT_GET/SET / LOCAL_IDX_GET /
  LOCAL_IDX_DOT_GET/SET. Compare `(int)slot < e->count` directly.

### Test Suite
- Full suite now reaches **1030/1030 PASS, 0 FAIL** (previously halted
  at `[29/31] Break & Continue` on the segfault above, reporting 141
  PASS).

## [0.11.1] — 2026-05-21

### Performance (DMG benchmark: 0.318 → 0.384 MHz, +21%)
- **In-place numeric mutation**: arithmetic ops reuse refcount-1 Values
  instead of allocating via make_num.
- **Dict field inline cache**: 128-entry direct-mapped cache for
  DOT_GET/DOT_SET (99.99% hit rate on DMG workload).
- **Superinstructions**: LOCAL_DOT_GET/SET, LOCAL_IDX_GET,
  LOCAL_IDX_DOT_GET/SET fuse 2-4 dispatches into one.
- **Stack-top arithmetic**: ARITH_FAST macro operates directly on
  stack[] without push/pop for num+num fast path.
- **JUMP_IF_FALSE/TRUE**: inlined numeric check bypasses is_truthy().
- **POP**: inlined val_decref avoids function call.

### Bug Fixes (Audit)
- **Break in for-loops**: emit LOOP_ENV_END before break jump to
  prevent env leak and stack corruption.
- **Observer `who is x`**: returns binding name ("x") instead of type
  name ("number"). New OP_INTERROGATE_NAMED opcode.
- **Observer `when is x`**: returns assignment count via per-slot
  assign_counts[] in Env. Tracks increments across env_set.
- **Compound assignment `a[f()] += x`**: index expression now evaluated
  exactly once via new OP_DUP2 opcode + compiler bytecode lowering.
- **Bitwise precedence**: comparison RHS now parses bitwise operators
  (`1 == 1 | 0` works).
- **Dict non-string keys**: runtime error instead of silent collapse
  to "?" key.
- **Postfix after grouping**: `(expr).field` and `(expr)[idx]` both
  parse correctly.
- **Dedent validation**: mismatched indentation levels now produce
  syntax errors.
- **Superinstruction error semantics**: LOCAL_DOT_GET/SET emit proper
  runtime_error for non-dict targets (was silently returning null).

### New Opcodes
- `OP_DUP2` — duplicate top two stack values
- `OP_INTERROGATE_NAMED` — who/when with binding name operand
- `OP_LOCAL_DOT_GET`, `OP_LOCAL_DOT_SET` — fused local.field access
- `OP_LOCAL_IDX_GET` — fused local[const] access
- `OP_LOCAL_IDX_DOT_GET`, `OP_LOCAL_IDX_DOT_SET` — fused local[n].field

## [0.11.0] — 2026-05-21

### Bytecode VM Completeness
- **Zero VM bugs remaining.** Fixed all 14 bytecode VM test failures
  from the 0.10.0 release. The VM is now fully compatible with the
  tree-walker's behavior across all 92 test files.

### Bug Fixes
- **Try/catch handler stack**: nested try/catch with rethrow now works
  correctly (max 8 nested per frame).
- **Type error reporting**: runtime_error for SUB, MUL, DIV, MOD, NEG
  on wrong types; DOT_GET/DOT_SET on non-dict; INDEX_GET/INDEX_SET
  for OOB and non-indexable; ITER_SETUP for non-iterable.
- **Error message compatibility**: "out of bounds" → "out of range";
  WHO interrogative returns "number"/"string"/"function" (not short names).
- **Division by zero**: warning to stderr instead of runtime_error
  (matches tree-walker behavior).
- **String concatenation**: string + non-string uses value_to_string
  instead of returning null.
- **Builtin result refcount**: sort/append returning their input no
  longer causes double-free.
- **Listcomp with filter**: save/restore stack depth at filter branch
  point (was crashing).
- **Break/continue outside loop**: emit NULL instead of phantom stack
  adjust (was corrupting closures containing break).
- **Observer obs_age**: increment in update_observer (was missing after
  eval.c → eigenscript.c migration).
- **1-element list args**: `f of [x]` passes `[x]` as a list, not `x`
  as a scalar (fixes softmax, mat_det, and similar builtins).
- **0-param functions**: call_eigs_fn skips param binding when
  param_count == 0 (was accessing NULL params).

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-21

### Architecture — Bytecode VM
- **Replaced AST tree-walker with bytecode VM.** All code now compiles to
  bytecode and runs through a stack-based VM with computed-goto dispatch.
  `eval.c` (1387 lines) deleted, replaced by `compiler.c` + `vm.c` + `chunk.c`
  (~2400 lines). Net +1250 lines for the entire VM.
- **60+ opcodes** covering all 31 AST node types: constants, arithmetic,
  comparison, bitwise, variables (local slots + name-based), control flow
  (jumps, loops, iteration), functions (closure, call, return), data
  structures (list, dict, index, dot), error handling (try/catch), observer
  system (interrogate, predicate, stall detection), and modules (import).
- **Non-recursive function calls.** `OP_CALL` pushes a new frame and
  continues the dispatch loop. No C stack recursion — recursion depth
  limited by `VM_FRAMES_MAX` (4096) instead of C stack size.
- **Stack-depth tracking** in the compiler validates branch/loop balance.
- **GET_LOCAL/SET_LOCAL** optimization for function parameters: direct
  env slot access bypasses hash table lookup.
- **Observer stall detection** (`OP_LOOP_STALL_CHECK`): while-loops exit
  after 100 iterations of `|dH| < threshold`. Sets `__loop_exit__` and
  `__loop_iterations__` env variables.

### Language
- **Compound assignment operators**: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`,
  `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`. Desugared in the parser to existing AST nodes.
  Works on variables, dot-access, and index-access.
- **Buffer iteration**: `for x in buffer:` and `[expr for x in buffer]` now
  work. `what`/`who` interrogation handles buffers. VAL_BUFFER is now a
  first-class iterable type.

### Performance
- **For-loop env reuse**: Reuse a single `Env` per for-loop and list
  comprehension instead of allocating/freeing per iteration. Falls back to
  fresh allocation when closures capture the loop scope.
- **Lazy observer entropy**: Assignments mark values dirty; `compute_entropy`
  deferred until observer state is actually read. In-place NUM fast path
  eagerly computes entropy (O(1) for numbers).
- **Thread-local observer state**: `g_last_observer` replaces the
  `__observer__` env variable, eliminating hash lookup and atomic refcount
  per assignment and function call.
- **String concat fast path**: `make_str_owned` avoids double-copy;
  STR+STR concat skips `value_to_string`.
- **Keyword dispatch**: `keyword_type` uses `switch(word[0])` instead of
  37 sequential `strcmp` calls.
- **Environment hash index**: FNV-1a hash table for O(1) variable lookup in
  `env_get`/`env_set`/`env_set_local`, replacing linear scan.
- **Dict hash index**: Dicts now use the same FNV-1a hash table for O(1) key
  lookup in `dict_get`/`dict_set`/`dict_remove`, replacing O(n) linear scan.
- **Loop condition fast path**: `eval_num_fast` extended with comparison
  operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`). Loop conditions like
  `while x < limit:` now evaluate with zero allocation.
- **Relaxed atomic refcounting**: `val_incref` uses `RELAXED` ordering,
  `val_decref` uses `ACQ_REL` (was `SEQ_CST`). Eliminates unnecessary full
  memory barriers on every refcount operation.
- **Allocation origin fix**: `list_append` and `env_set_local` now use the
  owning structure's arena flag (not `g_arena.active`) to decide allocation
  strategy, eliminating the `is_arena_ptr()` linear scan on every
  `free_value`.
- **Memory leak fixes**: Safe `val_decref` on fresh Values from loop
  conditions, list comprehension filters, and match patterns. Closure
  environments are freed when all referencing closures are destroyed (atomic
  `env_refcount`). Thread `call_env` is freed after thread body completes.
  Arena overflow allocations are tracked and freed on `arena_reset`.
  `arena_destroy` frees all arena blocks at program exit.

### Builtins
- `list_truncate of [list, new_len]` — in-place O(1) list shrink.
- `list_remove_at of [list, index]` — in-place element removal with memmove.
- `sort_by of [list, key_fn]` — C-backed O(n log n) qsort with key function
  (replaces O(n²) pure-EigenScript insertion sort in lib/sort.eigs).
- `sign_extend of [val, bits]` — sign-extend a value from a given bit width
- `scan_ints of text` / `scan_ints of [text, comment_marker]` — C-backed scan
  of whitespace-delimited signed integer tokens, optionally skipping comment
  lines
- `scan_int_tokens of text` / `scan_int_tokens of [text, comment_marker]` —
  C-backed token spans with signed-integer classification and value metadata
- `text_builder_new`, `text_builder_append`, `text_builder_append_line`,
  `text_builder_extend`, `text_builder_part_count`, `text_builder_clear`,
  and `text_builder_to_string` — native growable text builder builtins used by
  `lib/text_builder.eigs`
- `sort of list` — in-place qsort on numeric lists
- `read_bytes_buf of path` — read binary file as VAL_BUFFER (zero per-element alloc)
- `gfx_fb of [buf, w, h, x, y, scale]` — blit a buffer as a scaled texture
- `ppu_render_frame of [mem_buf, fb_buf]` — full Game Boy PPU rendering in C

### Standard Library
- `lib/int_vector.eigs` wraps root buffers as fixed-size integer vectors for
  solver-style dense integer state, with direct indexing and copy helpers.

### Hardening
- Finite-number invariant: numeric construction, scalar arithmetic, tensor
  arithmetic, math builtins, and numeric fast paths now prevent `NaN`/`Inf`
  from entering EigenScript values. `NaN` collapses to `0`; overflow and
  infinity saturate at `+/-1e308`; domain-limited inverse trig clamps inputs.
- Shift-amount bounds checks (`<<`, `>>`) — out-of-range yields 0, not UB
- Null guards on dot-assign, index-assign, and list comprehension targets
- JSON control-character escaping for bytes < 0x20
- F-string recursion depth limit (max 64 levels)
- Parser bounds checks for lambda lookahead
- HTTP Content-Length search scoped to headers only
- Store handle release before free (use-after-free fix)

## [0.9.3.4] — 2026-04-25

### UI Toolkit

- **Widget registry**: replace 74 hardcoded type dispatches with registry
  pattern. Adding a new widget type now requires one registration block
  instead of editing 6+ functions.
- **Layout position caching**: cache absolute positions (`_ax`/`_ay`) during
  layout pass, eliminating 53 per-frame tree walks in event dispatch.
- **Frame-rate independent timers**: cursor blink and tooltip delay now use
  millisecond timestamps instead of frame counters.
- **Keyboard accessibility**: 10 widget types (grid, chart, bar_chart,
  color_picker, canvas, waveform_view, piano_kb, editable_label, code_view,
  gauge) are now keyboard-accessible via Tab + arrow/Enter/Space.
- **File decomposition**: split 4522-line `ui.eigs` into 14 focused files
  grouped by widget category.
- **UI unit tests**: 81 new assertions covering constructors, registry,
  layout, hit-testing, focus cycling, scroll clamping, and keyboard nav.

### Bug Fixes

- **SDL2 dlsym crash**: validate all `dlsym` results — missing symbols now
  fail with a diagnostic instead of segfaulting via NULL function pointer.
- **SDL2 audio null-check**: `audio_open` now checks for audio symbol
  availability before calling.
- **`gfx_open` window leak**: destroy window on renderer creation failure.
- **`gfx_close` resource leak**: close audio device and `dlclose` SDL2
  library handle on shutdown.
- **Focus ring overwrite**: focus ring no longer fills over widget content
  with `panel_bg`; draws four edge rects instead.
- **Scroll wheel targeting**: wheel events now scroll only the scrollable
  widget under the cursor, not all scrollable containers.
- **`gfx_delay` CPU burn**: increased from 1ms to 8ms for software-renderer
  fallback when vsync is unavailable.

## [0.9.3.3] — 2026-04-25

### Security
- **`screen_render` overflow**: validate screen dimensions (max 10000x10000),
  use `size_t` for buffer size and `xcalloc_array` for allocation.
- **`builtin_join` overflow**: use `size_t` for length accumulation and
  `xmalloc`/`xmalloc_array` for allocations instead of raw `malloc`.
- **Test runner injection**: pass values to Python via `sys.argv` instead of
  shell-interpolated string in `check_range`.

### Hardening
- Eliminate all `sprintf` from the codebase — replaced with bounds-checked
  `snprintf` in `hash.c` (`bytes_to_hex`) and `builtins.c` (`random_hex`).
- Eliminate all `strcpy` — replaced with `memcpy` of known-length constants
  in `lint.c` and `main.c`.
- Zero unsafe string functions (`sprintf`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `gets`) remain.

## [0.9.3.2] — 2026-04-25

### Security
- **Lexer indent_stack overflow**: bounds-check indent depth (max 64 levels)
  before pushing to stack-allocated array.
- **Parser list/dict literal overflow**: bounds-check element count (max 1024)
  before writing to heap-allocated array.
- **`read_file_util` ftell guard**: reject negative ftell return before
  allocating and reading — prevents heap overflow on unseekable files.
- **`compute_entropy` depth guard**: cap recursion at 64 levels to prevent
  stack overflow on deeply nested list/dict values.
- **`value_to_string` depth guard**: same cap, returns `[...]` at depth 64.
- **CORS header injection**: strip `\r` and `\n` from CORS origin to prevent
  HTTP response header injection.
- **Static file TOCTOU**: serve the realpath-resolved canonical path instead
  of the original request path, closing the symlink-swap window.
- **HTTP route handler leak**: free TokenList after each request to prevent
  per-request memory leak under sustained traffic.
- **Model JSON array overread**: check for `]` before each element read in
  `json_parse_1d_array` to avoid reading past short arrays.
- **`save_model_weights` loop bounds**: use `size_t` for `vs * dm` loop bounds
  to prevent int overflow.

### Hardening
- **`env_set_local`**: emit diagnostic when scope exceeds MAX_VARS (512)
  instead of silently dropping bindings.

## [0.9.3.1] — 2026-04-24

### Security
- **Handle table**: Store, Thread, and Channel handles now use a validated
  handle table instead of storing raw C pointers as doubles. Forged or stale
  handle IDs return null instead of dereferencing arbitrary memory.
- **copy_into**: reject negative offset (was heap corruption via OOB write).
- **tensor_to_flat**: prevent integer overflow on large tensor dimensions via
  `safe_size_mul` and 10M element cap.
- **ext_db**: fix JSON injection in `db_connect` error path and
  `db_query_json` column names — replaced manual string interpolation with
  `eigs_json_escape_string`.
- **ext_http**: generate session IDs from `/dev/urandom` instead of
  predictable `time()+counter`; use stack-local buffer instead of static.
- **ext_http**: route code handlers now execute in an isolated child
  environment so side-effects don't leak across requests.

### Hardening
- Makefile: enable `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, PIE, and full RELRO.

### Docs
- ARCHITECTURE.md: fix stale function names (`eval_stmt`→`eval_node`,
  `EigenValue`→`Value`, lexer location `eigenscript.c`→`lexer.c`).

## [0.9.3] — 2026-04-22

  titration, climate modeling, signal analysis.

### Hardening
- Documented Euler invariant in range builtin, suppressed cppcheck false flag

- **free_ast** made public for proper cleanup
- **shellcheck**: All warnings fixed in test runner
- **Linter dogfooding**: stdlib cleaned — `while` → `loop while` in audio,

  new `AST_INDEX_ASSIGN` node. Supports chained access: `items[0].x is 10`,
  `grid[r][c] is val`. 15 tests.
- **Real concurrency**: 12 global variables converted to `__thread` thread-local
  storage. Each OS thread gets its own eval state, error handling, and arena.
  Atomic `val_incref`/`val_decref` for thread-safe reference counting.

### New Builtins

- Drag & drop with drop targets and reorder support
- Modal dialog stack
- Window resize with automatic re-layout

### Standard Library — NEW MODULES

  (df_from_csv, df_select, df_where, df_sort_by, df_group_by, df_join, etc.)
- **`lib/stats.eigs`**: Statistical functions — 18 functions (mean, median,
  std_dev, variance, quantile, histogram, correlation, describe, etc.)

  parallel_map, parallel_each, worker_pool
- **`lib/store.eigs`**: EigenStore high-level layer — find, find_one, upsert,
  bulk_put, to_dataframe
- **`lib/ui.eigs`**: UI toolkit (see above)

  break/continue, imports, observer interrogatives with real entropy tracking,
  80+ C builtin bridge

  with AST node, environment, and line number

### Graphical Debugger — NEW

- GC coverage: val_free for all value types (string, list, dict, function)
- Import error path coverage (module not found, parse errors)
- Terminal builtin coverage (screen_*, raw_key)
- EigenStore CRUD + persistence tests
- Concurrency tests (spawn/join, channels, producer/consumer)

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-17

### New Builtins
- **`monotonic_ns` / `monotonic_ms`**: high-precision monotonic timer via
  `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` — sub-millisecond precision, no fork,
  no shell. For per-frame perf instrumentation.

### Runtime
- **System stdlib resolution**: `load_file` and `import` now search
  executable-relative stdlib paths and `~/.local/lib/eigenscript/` as fallback
  after CWD and script-relative paths. Source-tree binaries can find
  `../lib/*.eigs`, installed binaries can find `../lib/eigenscript/*.eigs`, and
  `make install` still copies `lib/*.eigs` to the user-local directory.
  External projects (Tidepool, iLambdaAi) can use stdlib without copying files.

### Documentation
- Gap analysis for real-world program classes (CLI tools, web servers,
  games, data pipelines, ML training)
- ROADMAP.md updated with all completed features by version
- Review findings from 0.8.0 high-level review addressed

### Testing
- 614 tests (up from 614 in 0.8.0 — timer builtins covered by existing
  infra)

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-17

### Language
- **`unobserved` block**: user-level opt-out of observer tracking. Inside
  the block, numeric assignments to local vars and dict fields mutate the
  existing `Value` in place (identity preserved, `data.num` updated), and
  `update_observer` is skipped. Outside the block, normal observed
  semantics resume unchanged. Nested blocks compose via a depth counter.
  Measurement: ~22% faster on a 200k-iteration mutation hot loop. Covered
  by 8 new tests in `tests/test_unobserved.eigs`. Syntax:
  ```
  unobserved:
      game.px is game.px + game.vx * DT
  ```

### Hardening
- **Refcount GC — unified teardown path**: `free_value` and `value_free`
  collapsed into a single `free_value` that handles all composite types
  (STR, JSON_RAW, LIST, DICT, FN) and uses `val_decref` for child
  teardown. Previously two near-duplicate functions coexisted: one had no
  DICT/FN handling (silent leak when `val_decref` freed a dict), the
  other recursed with the wrong function on dict children (double-free
  risk on shared Values). Unified path is both leak-free and
  sharing-safe. Two regression tests added for shared values across
  lists and dicts.
- **Bitwise builtins — type checks + defined shift semantics**:
  `bit_and/or/xor/shl/shr` now validate both args are `VAL_NUM` before
  dereferencing `.data.num` (previously read a garbage union field on
  type mismatch — undefined behavior). Shift counts masked with `& 31`
  so `bit_shl of [1, 32]` and similar have defined behavior instead of
  relying on x86's natural modulo-shift. Uses `uint32_t` internally with
  a final cast back to `int32_t` for sign preservation. +6 test checks.

### Security
- **Stack buffer overflow in f-string lexer (high)**: `src/lexer.c:206` wrote
  into a 64 KB stack buffer without bounds-checking the accumulator index.
  An f-string literal segment longer than 64 KB would overrun the stack and
  crash (or corrupt adjacent frames). Deployments that accept untrusted
  `.eigs` source are advised to upgrade. Fixed as part of the strbuf
  migration below.
- **HTTP 404 response JSON injection (low)**: `send_404` in `src/ext_http.c`
  interpolated the unescaped request path into the JSON body. A crafted URL
  containing `"` could break the JSON structure. The path is now omitted from
  the response body (server-side logs still record it).
- **HTTP static-file confinement hardened (medium)**: `src/ext_http.c` now
  resolves the candidate path and the configured `static_dir` with `realpath`
  and rejects anything whose resolved prefix is not the root. This replaces
  the previous `strstr(rel, "..")` check and also defends against symlinks
  inside `static_dir` that point outside it. New regression test `HS06b`
  covers the symlink-escape case.
- **Threat model documented in `SECURITY.md`**: clarifies that `.eigs`
  authors are trusted (the runtime gives scripts the same file/process/network
  access the host user has), while the runtime itself must be safe against
  malformed input, crafted HTTP requests, and malicious model files.

### Hardening
- **Overflow-safe allocator helpers**: new `safe_size_mul`, `xmalloc_array`,
  `xcalloc_array`, `xrealloc_array` in `src/arena.c` abort cleanly on
  `nmemb * size` wrap. Migrated multiplicative allocations across
  `model_io.c`, `model_infer.c`, `model_train.c`, `parser.c`, `lexer.c`,
  `eigenscript.c`, `builtins.c`. `tensor_load` now rejects `rows*cols`
  that exceed `INT_MAX` up front.
- **Growable string buffers replace fixed MAX_STR ceilings**: new
  `src/strbuf.c` helper with doubling growth. Adopted by f-string and
  regular-string lexing, `regex_replace`, JSON encoder/parser,
  `value_to_string` (list + dict), and REPL stdin. Strings, regex
  output, JSON, and f-strings now grow with memory instead of silently
  truncating at 64 KB.
- **Dynamic HTTP request buffer**: `src/ext_http.c handle_request` now
  allocates a heap reqbuf that grows via `xrealloc_array`, replacing
  the 1 MB stack array. Default body cap raised from 1 MB → 16 MiB,
  configurable at runtime via `EIGS_HTTP_MAX_BODY`.
- **`strcpy`/`strcat` hardening**: `src/eval.c:164` string concatenation
  rewritten with `memcpy` + pre-computed lengths for consistency with
  the rest of the hardened codebase.
- Deleted `MAX_STR` / `MAX_BODY` / `MAX_HEADER` from `eigenscript.h`
  (no remaining consumers).

### Architecture
- **`builtins.c` split**: tensor code (~990 lines — all `builtin_tensor_*`,
  `builtin_random_normal`, `builtin_numerical_grad*`, `builtin_sgd_update*`,
  `builtin_tensor_save/load` plus their static helpers) moved to new
  `src/builtins_tensor.c`. Cross-TU prototypes live in new
  `src/builtins_internal.h`. `builtins.c` dropped from 3079 → 2091 lines.

### BREAKING
- Default HTTP request body cap rose from 1 MB to 16 MiB. Deployments
  that relied on the 1 MB ceiling as a DoS mitigation should set
  `EIGS_HTTP_MAX_BODY=1048576`.

### Testing
- 4 new large-buffer regression tests (`test_large_strings`,
  `test_fstring_large`, `test_regex_large`, `test_json_large`) that
  would fail against v0.7.0 with silent truncation or stack overflow.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-16

### Language
- **Pattern matching**: `match expr: case pattern: ...` with wildcard `_`
- **Pipe operator**: `data |> transform |> sort` — left-to-right data flow
- **Lambda expressions**: `(x) => x * 2` — inline anonymous functions with closure capture
- **Break/continue**: proper loop control flow
- **Dot-assignment**: `config.name is "value"` on dicts
- **Multiline collections**: lists and dicts can span multiple lines
- **Regex builtins**: `regex_match`, `regex_find`, `regex_replace` (POSIX ERE)
- **Import system**: `import math` loads modules into namespaced dicts

### Architecture
- **Source split**: monolithic `eigenscript.c` → `lexer.c`, `parser.c`, `eval.c`, `builtins.c`
- **OOM-safe allocations**: all value constructors use `xmalloc`/`xcalloc` wrappers
- **Recursion depth guard**: `eval_node` checks against max depth to prevent stack overflow
- **Stack protector**: `-fstack-protector-strong` enabled in builds

### Security
- Fixed shell injection in `ls` builtin
- Hardened `strcpy` into fixed-size op fields with `snprintf`
- Reject negative/malformed Content-Length in HTTP server
- Reject out-of-range model dimensions; safe `size_t` casts in weight allocations
- Softmax NaN guard: zero-sum falls back to uniform distribution
- Three stdlib correctness fixes (math, template, test modules)

### Testing
- **552 tests** across 40+ suites (up from 224 in 0.6.0)
- Fuzz testing: 44 edge case + adversarial tests under ASAN+UBSan
- Coverage targets: `make coverage`, `make fuzz`, `make fuzz-run`
- CLI/REPL, HTTP, DB, model extension test suites
- Formal EBNF grammar specification (`docs/GRAMMAR.md`)

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-16

### Language
- **REPL**: Run `eigenscript` with no arguments for an interactive session
- **Named function parameters**: `define add(a, b) as:` — no more manual `n[0]`/`n[1]` unpacking
- **String interpolation**: `f"Hello {name}, {x * 2}"` — expressions inside braces are evaluated
- **Native dictionaries**: first-class dictionary type with `{}` literals and `.key` access
- **eval builtin**: `eval of "expr"` — evaluate a string as EigenScript at runtime
- Backward compatible: `define foo as:` with single `n` argument still works
- `n` is always available in all functions for compatibility with existing code

### Error Handling
- **try/catch blocks**: `try: ... catch err: ...` — runtime errors are now recoverable
- **throw builtin**: `throw of "message"` — raise errors from user code
- Nested try/catch with re-throw support
- All runtime errors (undefined variable, type error, index out of bounds, etc.) are catchable

### Meta-Circular Interpreter
- **lib/eigen.eigs**: EigenScript interpreter written in EigenScript
- Tokenizer, parser, and evaluator implemented in pure EigenScript
- `eigen_run of source` evaluates EigenScript source strings end-to-end

### Closures
- Functions capture their defining environment (already worked, now documented)
- `make_adder`, `make_multiplier`, factory patterns all work correctly

### Code Quality
- Removed `n` binding bloat from named-param functions
- All 25 stdlib modules converted to named parameters
- Fixed potential snprintf buffer overflow in list-to-string conversion (CodeQL #14-16)
- Added least-privilege permissions to CI workflow (CodeQL #17)

## [0.5.0] — 2025-04-03
