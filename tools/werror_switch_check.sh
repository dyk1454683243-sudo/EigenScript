# Uniform warning-error gate (the #817 follow-up from PR #817 discussion).
#
# #738 made every ASTType/ValType/opcode switch exhaustive so the flag has
# teeth; #786/#817 then put `-Werror=switch` on every compile line in the
# tree. #826 adds `-Werror=comment`: a warning in the public header reaches
# every translation unit, so treating the class as an error keeps future
# header comments from training contributors to ignore build output. This
# gate keeps both invariants holding: it dry-runs every Makefile target that
# compiles C (`make -n -B`) and asserts the UNIFORM invariant — every emitted
# compile invocation carries every required warning-error flag. Uniform, not
# variants-vs-auxiliary: a gate that classifies targets into "real" and
# "auxiliary" legs encodes a judgement that would need re-litigating at every
# audit; asserting the flags on every compile invocation is simpler and cannot
# be argued out of a leg.
#
# How this gate MATCHES (#1122). Every matcher below reads a here-string or a
# file, never a pipe. `printf '%s\n' "$x" | grep -q RE` under `set -o pipefail`
# — which this script sets — is a RACE, not a test: `grep -q` exits the instant
# it matches and closes the read end, the still-writing `printf` takes SIGPIPE
# and exits 141, and pipefail reports the PIPELINE as 141, a FAILED match,
# while grep's own status was 0, MATCHED (#1120). Thirteen sites here were that
# shape. `grep -qE RE <<<"$x"` is ONE command: bash never blocks writing a
# here-string, there is no second process to kill, and pipefail is not
# consulted — so grep's flags, pattern and LINE-ORIENTED semantics are all
# preserved exactly, which matters here because these patterns are real EREs.
# Measured on a 4 MB subject, 200 evaluations: pipeline form 200/200 wrong,
# here-string form 0/200. tools/pipefail_verdict_check.sh is the gate.
#
# What counts as a compile invocation (the recognition rule):
#   dry-run recipes are joined at backslash continuations, then SPLIT into
#   individual invocations at shell separators (; && || |) — one logical
#   recipe line can hold several compiler calls, and each call must carry
#   the flag on its own: a test over the merged text would let the first
#   invocation's flag cover an unguarded second one. Each invocation with
#   a compiler command word (gcc/clang/cc/emcc/$CC/${CC}, including the
#   ${CC:-gcc} / ${CC-gcc} default forms with or without the colon, the
#   .exe suffix, quoted or unquoted, and inside either spelling of a
#   command substitution — $( ) or backticks)
#   that COMPILES — it names a .c
#   source, or (for-loop bodies over a $var, like the coverage leg) it
#   carries -c — is one examined unit, counted and checked separately.
#   Pure link invocations (coverage's `gcc --coverage -o ...` over .o
#   files) name no .c and carry no -c: they compile nothing and are
#   excluded by definition — the flag is a compile-time option.
#   The flag is matched as a whole argument, never a substring:
#   `-Werror=switch-enum` is a different warning and must NOT satisfy
#   this gate. The same whole-argument rule applies to every required flag.
#
# Compiles hidden INSIDE shell scripts are invisible to `make -n`, so the
# scripts whose compile lines the classifier can recognize are audited
# DIRECTLY (#835): comment lines stripped, then the script text goes
# through the same join/split/classify pipeline as a dry-run stream, with
# the same per-script zero-line hard failure. The six compiler surfaces in
# the issue are all covered: build.sh's `$SOURCES`/`$LSP_SOURCES`, the two
# freestanding scripts, the stack soak, and web/build.sh's `${SOURCES[@]}`.
# The recognizer treats those source-list variables as compile evidence, so
# an audit cannot pass merely because a script hides its sources in a shell
# array. The final probes regenerate both LSP public index headers and
# pre-include each in the public-header translation unit, covering generated
# block comments compiled by the LSP path but absent from a fresh checkout.
#
# A gate that silently matches nothing is worse than no gate — it passes
# forever, and a gate that silently matches LESS is the same failure wearing
# a green badge. Three assertions prevent that. PER TARGET: a dry run
# yielding zero compile invocations is a hard failure naming the target —
# each of the 22 targets emits at least one today, and the one-line auxiliary
# legs (jit-smoke, fuzz, freestanding-libc-diff, ...) are exactly where
# #817's fixes live; a global total cannot see one of those die. GLOBALLY:
# an examined count under the floor (100) hard-fails as a matcher-broke
# signal (the 11 VARIANTS alone emit >200 `-c` invocations under -B). And
# PER-TARGET COVERAGE (#921): every target's examined count must meet a
# committed floor (TARGET_FLOORS), because the first two assertions only see
# TOTAL loss and global collapse — a target that loses most of its compile
# lines to a batch sibling sharing a prerequisite stays non-zero and keeps
# the global total plausible. Checked in BOTH directions: a pinned floor with
# no count means the target left TARGETS entirely, dropping 100% of its lines
# while every other assertion still passes. And ENROLLMENT: the three lists
# above (TARGETS, SCRIPT_AUDITS, TARGET_FLOORS) only cross-check each OTHER, so
# a compile surface never added to any of them was invisible to all of them —
# a new Makefile target running an unflagged `gcc -c src/vm.c` left this gate
# printing its clean-tree output and exiting 0. enrollment_check anchors the
# lists to the tree instead: any target emitting a compile line that no audited
# target emits, and any compile-bearing script outside SCRIPT_AUDITS, is a hard
# failure. The examined count is always printed.
#
# Usage: tools/werror_switch_check.sh [--selftest | --print-counts |
#                                      --headers-only | --no-headers]
#   --headers-only / --no-headers : the two halves of this gate, split so CI
#                can cache one of them (#1160). The generated-header probes at
#                the bottom RUN the LSP index generators, and those generators
#                read C SOURCES (gen_lsp_builtin_index.sh reads the reserved
#                observer words out of src/lexer.c). Their verdict therefore
#                moves with .c content, which the audit cache key deliberately
#                does NOT hash — a blind critic planted `return (TOK_REPORT);`
#                in src/lexer.c and got a FAILING audit behind an UNCHANGED
#                key. So the cheap half (--headers-only: two generator runs
#                plus two -fsyntax-only compiles) runs UNCACHED on every CI
#                run, and only the expensive half (--no-headers: the dry runs
#                and the script scans, whose inputs are the Makefile and the
#                tracked *.sh) is cached. Default (no flag) runs BOTH, which is
#                what every local run and the suite's [99i] still do.
#   --selftest : feed synthetic dry-run streams (each fault shape planted
#                in-memory, no tree mutation) through the classifier and
#                confirm every one is classified correctly — proves the
#                checker isn't vacuously green.
#   --print-counts : run the real dry runs and print the per-target examined
#                counts in TARGET_FLOORS format, for pasting back after an
#                intentional coverage change.

# Compile-bearing shell scripts audited directly (#835) — see header.

#                                  the amalgamation by hand; it compiles nothing.
#   tools/werror_switch_check.sh — this gate. Its own header probe runs
#                                  `$CC -Werror=comment -fsyntax-only` on one
#                                  file deliberately, and its matcher patterns
#                                  contain compiler names as DATA.
#   tests/test_lint_linkage.sh   — a LINKAGE probe (#922). It compiles lint.c and
#                                  lint_host.c with `-w` ON PURPOSE: it asserts a
#                                  symbol stays TU-local, and warnings would only
#                                  add noise. Requiring -Werror=switch here would
#                                  test nothing the real build does not.
#   tests/test_amalgamation.sh   — compiles the generated single-file
#                                  amalgamation as a downstream CONSUMER would,
#                                  with a consumer's flags. Pinning our internal

# tests/test_leak_guard.sh and tests/run_all_tests.sh joined in #925: widening
# the recognizer made their compiles VISIBLE for the first time. They were
# never exempt — they were unseen, which is worse, because an exemption is a
# decision on record. test_leak_guard.sh:56 compiles the ENTIRE runtime
# ($SRCS, the largest compile surface in the tree) and carried NEITHER
# required flag until this change.
# tests/test_asan_gfx.sh joined in #1007: it builds its own asan-gfx
# interpreter (deliberately not via `make`, which would re-point
# src/eigenscript under the suite) plus two leak controls, so four real
# compile invocations that no make target covers.
# tools/ilp32_syntax_check.sh joined with [99i3]: clang -m32 -fsyntax-only
# over the playground TUs (pages.yml wasm32 stand-in). Its floor moved 2 -> 4
# when that gate stopped hand-typing the wasm32 predefines: the two `-E -dM`
# derivations that read the target's and the host's macro worlds are compile
# invocations by this recognizer (`-x c`), so a floor of 2 would have let both
# of them be deleted while still printing OK. It moved 4 -> 8 when that gate
# stopped hand-typing emcc's OPTION grammar and started measuring instead:
# each new derivation is a compile line this recognizer sees — the `-###`
# probe that asks whether the clang driver knows a token, the `-###` run that
# reads back the driver's own `-x c` inputs, the per-header availability probe
# and the value-parity probe that measures which reconciliations glibc
# refuses. A floor left at 4 would let any four of the eight be deleted while
# the gate still printed OK, which is the exact failure this table exists for.
# It moved 8 -> 11 earlier in round 7 after a blind critic measured the gap:
# `--print-counts` said 11 for this file while the floor still said 8, so any
# THREE of its audited compile lines could have lost -Werror=switch, or been
# deleted, with [99i] green. It moved again, 11 -> 12, later the same round
# (#1232's flags fix) — the source of the extra audited line was not traced
# further than `--print-counts` itself; ask the tool again before trusting
# either number. The number is the tool's own measurement, not a guess — re-run
# `--print-counts` after adding a
# derivation here, the way this paragraph has had to be re-read each round.

    # the real repo, with a planted unenrolled compile going unreported. Fall
    # back to find, and refuse to pass on an empty enumeration.

    # The fallback is chosen by WHERE WE ARE, never by whether git produced

    # silently swap populations whenever `git ls-files` failed for a reason
    # that had nothing to do with the tree — a fork/exec that lost a race for
    # memory under a loaded box being the observed one. `find` then enumerates
    # UNTRACKED files too: build output, scratch dirs, another run's extracted

    # unenrolled script, so the gate goes red naming a file that is not part of

    # failure seen under load: the audit half printed its own "gate OK" and the

# ---- #925: assert the RECOGNIZER's own coverage -------------------------
#
# Widening the two patterns above is necessary and not sufficient: they are
# hand-written lists, and this is the third time they have drifted from the tree.
# Every other assertion in this gate — the per-target floors, the reverse loop,
# enrollment_check, MIN_LINES — counts what is_compile_invocation recognises, so
# a miss HERE is invisible to all of them. A compile line the recognizer skips is
# not "unflagged", it is not there.
#
# So: cross-check the strict recognizer against a deliberately OVER-BROAD one
# (a compiler command word appears at all) over every tracked shell script, and
# hard-fail on anything the broad matcher sees and the strict one does not,
# unless it is waived below with a reason. That turns "keep the patterns current
# by convention" into a checked invariant.
#
# The comparison runs through this gate's OWN strip_comments | join_continuations
# | split_invocations pipeline. Comparing raw file lines instead reports every
# backslash continuation as a miss — measured, it produced 13 false alarms
# against 3 real ones, which is how a coverage check gets muted for noise.
recognizer_broad_match() {
    # This MUST be broader than is_compile_invocation on every axis, or the
    # cross-check is blind exactly where the strict matcher is.
    #
    # The first version was broader only in CONTEXT (it admitted more surrounding
    # punctuation) while sharing the strict matcher's hand-written compiler-NAME
    # list and its "no prefix" anchoring. So `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`,
    # `/usr/bin/gcc`, `clang-18` and `${CROSS}gcc` were invisible to BOTH — and a
    # check cannot report a miss its own broad matcher cannot see. That is the
    # same two-lists-validating-each-other failure this gate exists to prevent,
    # reproduced one level up in the fix for it.
    #
    # So: any whitespace-delimited token CONTAINING a compiler name, with any
    # prefix and any suffix. Over-matching here is free — it only adds waiver
    # load, which is visible and reviewable. Under-matching is silent.
    # The compiler name must be a whole COMPONENT of the token: at its start, or
    # immediately after a `/`, `-` or `}` (path, cross-prefix, ${VAR} expansion),
    # with an optional -VERSION suffix. Matching any token merely CONTAINING the
    # name is too broad in a way that destroys the check's usefulness — measured,
    # it fired on `acc`, `accumulate`, `accept` and `accuracy` in ordinary test
    # scripts (8 false alarms), and a check that cries wolf gets muted.
    #
    # Six forms were invisible to BOTH matchers before this change, measured on
    # the shipped patterns at 50de57e: `gcc.exe`, `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe`,
    # `OUT=`gcc -c probe.c`` (backtick substitution), and the `${CC+alt}`,
    # `${CC-gcc}`, `${CC?msg}` colon-less operators. Blind TOGETHER is the
    # dangerous shape, not blind unevenly: the cross-check can only report a
    # strict miss that the broad matcher sees, so a form both share is invisible
    # to the very assertion built to catch drift — and the pre-filter (same
    # pattern) skips such a file outright, so its compile lines are never
    # audited at all.
    #
    # The invariant that prevents this is BROAD ⊇ STRICT on every axis: name
    # set, path/cross prefix, version and .exe suffix, ${CC} operator class, and
    # substitution spelling. That is not left to a comment — recognizer_axis_parity
    # below asserts it mechanically over one representative line per axis, and
    # --selftest fails if any widening of the strict matcher lands without the
