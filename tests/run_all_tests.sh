# ---- #988: child `.sh` tests gate on exit status, not just markers ----------
# rc_ok (above) fixed exactly this disease for `.eigs` programs: "marker-grep
# alone used to let a crash *after* correct output pass". The ~45 child `.sh`
# tests were still on the marker-only side of that line, because the
# idiomatic call site is
#     FOO_OUTPUT=$(bash "$TESTS_DIR/test_foo.sh" 2>&1)
# and a command substitution keeps the child's stdout while DISCARDING its
# exit status. The section then decided purely on `grep -c "FAIL:"`. So a
# child that printed two PASS: lines and then segfaulted reported a passing
# section, and a child that did not exist at all (127) reported
# "0/0 passed, 0 failed" — also a pass. Reproduced at 139, 127 and 1.
#
# The fix is central rather than 45 local `$?` checks, because the local form
# is exactly what every future site would have to remember. `bash` is a
# function here, so every child invocation is routed through it; when a child
# exits nonzero it emits a synthetic `FAIL:` line on the child's own stdout.
# That lands inside the caller's `$(...)` capture, so the EXISTING per-site
# `grep -c "FAIL:"` logic counts it and the section fails, with no site edit.
# Sites that stream rather than capture still see it on the terminal, and
# their `if bash ...; then` already reads the status directly.
#
# The ledger is a FILE, not a variable: the increment happens inside the
# caller's command substitution, i.e. in a subshell, so a shell variable would
# be discarded along with everything else the subshell touched — the same
# class of loss this whole section is about.
#
# The second half of the bar — "a section that executes zero checks must not
# report itself as passing" — is NOT covered by exit status: a child can exit
# 0 having done nothing, and `[42] CLI & REPL (15 checks)` then prints
# "PASS: all 0 CLI checks" and contributes 0 to TOTAL, so even the RESULTS
# line looks untouched. For the `test_*.sh` population (46 of 48 follow the
# marker convention) the child's output is therefore captured and a run with
# NO markers at all is failed as vacuous. Capture is confined to that
# population deliberately: the `tools/*.sh` gates print their own prose, and
# buffering their output would change what a reader sees for no gain.
#
# Two side effects of capturing, stated because they are real and small:
# `$(...)` strips trailing newlines (one is added back, so a child ending in
# several blank lines loses them), and a captured child's stderr now reaches
# the caller BEFORE its stdout rather than interleaved. Neither changes marker
# counting, which is what every section decides on; both would matter to a

# [116] Silent-tolerance audit batch-2 (#497/#498/#499/#501/#502/#511/#512).
# Builtins that used to return a silent null/0/""/wrong-order on invalid
# input now raise a catchable error from the closed error-kind set: matmul
# (shape/type), sha256/md5/hmac (non-string), range (non-numeric + past the
# 1M cap), sort_by (non-numeric key), get_at/set_at + buf_get/buf_set (OOB
# → index_range, matching the [] operator). Each case asserts it raises (and
# the kind where it matters) plus a happy-path sanity check.
# Batch-2b (#500/#503/#504/#506/#507/#508) extends the same file: len (no-
# length type), append (non-list target), regex_match/find/replace (invalid
# pattern → value, non-string → type_mismatch), substr (negative start counts
# from the end), list_truncate (negative len → value), json_path (empty path
# segment → value).
# Batch-2c adds #495: json_decode rejects truncated / partial / trailing-
# garbage JSON (was a silent partial value; also made a genuine `null`
# indistinguishable from a parse failure).
# Batch-2d adds #505 (send to a closed channel raises value, was a silent
# drop), #490 (load_file of a missing path raises io, was stderr + null), and
# #494 (eval of a truncated expression raises a catchable parse error).

# live values. Runs on EVERY build; the wrong answers are visible without a
# sanitizer. Part B (#548): sanitizer builds full-scan past

# release builds, where the guard is compiled out by design.

# [133] gfx argument-type guards (#1007 — probe-gated: needs a gfx build).
# Three *_open builtins read `.data.num` with no type check, so a string
# where a number belonged reinterpreted a char* as a double: gfx_open
# answered 1 for a 0x0 window, audio_open and audio_capture_open answered
# real device ids and took the audio device with them.
#
# TWO PASSES, and the strict one is the load-bearing half. The non-strict
# stand-in for these guards is 0 — which is ALSO what all three answer when
# libSDL2 is simply absent, as it is on the CI runners. So the plain pass
# passes on an unfixed binary in that environment and proves nothing there;
# the strict pass demands a RAISE, and before #1007 `ext_gfx.c` contained no
# rt_error call at any line, so it cannot pass on unfixed code anywhere.
# Measured on this repo with libSDL2 present: unfixed fails 3 rows in each
# pass (got 1 / 2 / 3, and "none" for each expected raise).
#
# COUNTS ARE PINNED, because both the strict block and the sample-coercion
# block sit behind conditions inside the .eigs file and a skipped block still
# prints "All tests passed". The expected numbers depend only on whether an
# audio device came up, which the file reports, so the pin is exact in both
# environments rather than a floor.
#
# WHAT THIS SECTION COVERS, since the answer changed: the whole ext_gfx.c
# argument surface, not just the three *_open type-pun guards it started as.
# The drawing half — the ~52 `make_null()` sites where gfx_rect/gfx_line/
# gfx_text answered a wrong-typed argument by silently drawing nothing — is
# in it since #1007's second pass, and so are the COERCION shapes
# (gfx_text_width's scale, audio_pause's flag, audio_mix's sample elements),
# which have no stand-in return and are invisible to
# tools/failsoft_classify_check.sh by construction.
#
# The load-bearing row is the PIXEL PROOF in the non-strict pass, gated on a
# real renderer: pre-fix, a wrong-typed colour painted BLACK over the cleared
# pixel — a wrong drawing, not a missing one — and gfx_read reads it back.
# That is the only row here that can see the defect on real pixels; every
# other non-strict row asserts the answer is UNCHANGED, which is the
# byte-identity half of the claim. The strict pass discriminates without SDL.
#
# Still NOT covered: whether the classifications recorded in ext_gfx.c are
# RIGHT ([99r]'s population plus this section's pins together), and leaks on
# those paths ([137]).

# [134] Pointer-disclosure oracle (#1007 — probe-gated: needs a gfx build).
#
# The sharpest half of #1007 is not a wrong answer, it is an INFORMATION LEAK:
# several ext_gfx builtins BUILD their returned data out of an unchecked
# `.data.num`, so a string argument copied a reinterpreted `char *` into a
# list the script reads back. On the parent binary
# `audio_sweep of ["100", 200, 0.01, 0.5, 0]` returned samples beginning
# 3.62e-314 / 3.44e-314 / 3.71e-314 on three consecutive runs — an ASLR
# pointer, fresh each time.
#
# That per-run freshness IS the detector, and it needs no name list: run each
# probe TWICE and diff. A stable answer is fine whatever it is; a differing
# one means address-space state reached the program. This is why the check is
# here and not in the .eigs file — a program cannot compare itself across two
# processes.
#
# The list was DERIVED this way, not read: writing the fix from the six audio
# generators left `audio_gain` unguarded, and only running the sweep found it.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL. With every site fixed, "nothing differs" is also what an
# empty probe list, a mistyped path, or a binary that errors on every program
# prints. So the last row is a genuinely nondeterministic expression that MUST
# be reported as differing; if it does not, the detector is blind and the
# section fails regardless of the other rows.

# 35. WITNESS for the multithreaded precondition. The pass declines when the

#     scored 30/30 — so per §37/§64 it was a claim, not a guard.
#     The observable is the gate DECISION, reachable without a sanitizer: a
#     module loaded AFTER a spawn is compiled while multithreaded, so scanning
#     its own literal load must bail and leave the unit `observed`. Verified

#     40 — written in the same commit as the round-11 fix). Prose did not stop
#     it; per the standing hooks-beat-advice rule a thrice-bitten mistake gets
#     a write-site gate. This greps THIS FILE's [99u] region for bare
#     `$EIGS_BIN ... | head/tail -1)` captures; each existing one is WAIVED by
#     count with its reason, and the count is pinned so a new unrouted capture
#     — or a silently vanished waived one — both go red. Waived (4):
#       1x OBS_G19  — module rewritten between reads RAISES: nonzero rc and
#                     the raise text ARE the expectation; a crash reads red.
#       3x OBS_FR   — check 34 captures the stderr STATS line, not a program
#                     answer; a crash yields no stats line, an empty verdict,
#                     and the composite comparison goes red on its own.
#     Everything else must route through obs_gate_answer / the inline rc
#     pattern / obs_gate_closed_verdict.
#     ANCHORED ON THE CAPTURE SHAPE, NOT THE BINARY'S NAME. The first version
#     grepped for `$EIGS_BIN ... | head -1)` — and the round-12 bug that
#     motivated this gate was spelled `"$OBS_EIGS_ABS" ... | head -1)`, so the
#     gate could not catch the very defect it was built for, and the natural
#     next accidental spelling (copying check 40's cd scaffolding, or a quoted
#     "$EIGS_BIN", or `head -n1`) evaded identically. Found by a blind critic
#     (round 13), plant-verified in both directions. The shape that matters is
#     "merged-stderr program output piped straight into a first/last-line
#     pick": that is what makes a capture rc-blind, whatever the binary
#     variable is called.
#     RESIDUAL, stated exactly (§45 — full closure is impossible): `2>&1 |
#     sed -n 1p`, `| awk NR==1`, `|& head -1`, and a pipeline with a second
#     filter stage all evade this regex. The gate targets the two ACCIDENTAL
#     spellings that have actually occurred (2>&1 and 2>/dev/null into a
#     head/tail first/last-line pick); an author actively dodging it is out
#     of scope — review is the layer for that.

# ROUND 13 — A WINDOW THAT CANNOT HIDE THE CAUSE.
# Round 8 made these sections print the child's own words instead of grepping
# for "^RED", and that was right. The BOUND it chose (20 lines) then spent
# three rounds hiding the one part anybody needed: the docs-claims PATHS class
# prints its classifiers and its per-file work near the TOP of a ~110-line
# report, and the failure that has kept macOS red is visible only there. A tail
# is the wrong shape for a report whose beginning is its evidence.
#
# So: print EVERYTHING, up to 500 lines. Why a bound at all, and why that one
# is safe. The gate's green report is 110 lines and a fully failing one is a
# few hundred (one RED per unresolved claim, and a run that red on every claim
# would be reporting a broken TREE, not a broken gate). 500 covers that with
# room. And when the bound does bite, it is not a tail: the first 250 lines
# (banner, classifiers, the class that died) AND the last 250 (the per-class
# summary the gate now prints LAST) both survive, with the elision counted in

# [99zd] ROADMAP.md is a MILESTONE SET, and issue labels are enforced rather

# "we aren't labeling issues"): ROADMAP.md was a checkbox pile, most of it
# historical highlights under `## Completed`, so every counter of "roadmap
# items" was counting the past (ROADMAP.md's header derives both counts beside
# the commands that produce them; tools/docs_claims_check.sh executes those
# commands), and the open backlog was unlabelled — the labels gate's first real
# run after the hand sweep read `examined=35 missing=0`.
#
# A SUCCESSFUL EXIT IS NOT A MEASUREMENT (mechanical-gates §121). Round 1 of
# this section took `exit 0` as a pass: Astra removed ONLY the live-data walk
# from tools/roadmap_check.sh, left its fixture selftest intact, and this
# section read TOTAL=4 PASS=4.
#
# ROUND 2 ADDED A CONTRACT AND THEN TRUSTED IT — the wrong invariant.
# Round 2 had each gate publish `--contract` (its population regex and its
# selftest case count) and had this caller read BOTH from the gate. So the
# thing being policed supplied the yardstick: `POPULATION_RE=examined=|.*`
# admitted empty output, a contract permitting `examined=0` passed, and a gate
# with five plants deleted plus `SELFTEST_CASES=1` passed the daily workflow
# (round-2 blind critics, Astra checks 2 and 7). "One regex per gate" was the
# wrong invariant.
#
# ROUND 3 — TWO COPIES, KEPT EQUAL BY A TEST. Every pin below is a LITERAL in
# this caller. The caller asserts the gate's output against ITS OWN copy, and a
# SEPARATE check asserts the gate's `--contract` equals this copy verbatim. A
# drift is red BY NAME and is never auto-adopted; the caller is the independent
# witness, not a reader of the thing it polices. Three further round-3 rules:
#   * the population count group is `[1-9][0-9]*` — zero is never a population —
#     and EXACTLY ONE population line is required, so a duplicated line is red;
#   * the pinned regexes require a LIVE source token (`gh-api:`), so a
#     fixture-sourced run (`(source: fixture ...)`, which both callers accepted
#     in round 2 because their regex stopped before `(source:`) is red by name;
#   * the round-2 vacuity guard (`case "$re" in *examined=*`) is GONE. It was a
#     substring test that `POPULATION_RE='examined='` satisfied. The caller no
#     longer consumes the gate's regex at all, so its own pinned regex IS the
#     guard.
#
# The section also counts its OWN work. Each assertion that actually reached a
# verdict the caller accepts increments a witness, and the last check compares
# the three witnesses and the section's check count with pinned literals — so
# deleting or short-circuiting a check changes RESULTS instead of silently
# measuring less.
#
# The same section also loads every workflow file (tools/workflow_yaml_check.sh):
# round 1 shipped the daily lane as unparseable YAML, so the audit this section
# guards could never have run at all. Round 3: its selftest is skip-aware,
# because two of its plants need PyYAML and no runner had it — on 538288c that
# took linux/gcc, macOS and ASan shard 2/3 red (CI run 35599371704). The
# runners now install PyYAML (.devcontainer/Dockerfile, and a macOS setup step
# in ci.yml); when it is nevertheless absent THIS caller probes for it itself
# and allows exactly the pinned named-skip count, for that gate alone.
#
# None of these tools builds anything and all belong on the PR lane. Measured
# on the dev box 2026-09-21, after round 5 added the once-per-run KNOWN_REPOS
# verification: roadmap live pass 11.9 s (one `gh api` for the milestones, one
# `gh api orgs/<owner>/repos --paginate` for the repository list, and one per
# reference in the table), its selftest 7.0 s (entirely fixture-driven, no
# network); issue-labels live pass 1.5 s (one `gh api --paginate`), its
# selftest 1.7 s; workflow-yaml 1.7 s live and 4.2 s selftest.
# The GitHub-facing arms of each SKIP BY NAME without `gh` — or with `gh`
# present and UNAUTHENTICATED, which is a third state the macOS runner is in
# and round 2 reported as seven 404s. The structural arm never skips, so a
# runner with no credentials still refuses a checkbox.
#
# ROUND 4 — THE CALLER PROBES `gh` ITSELF, AND A LANE HOLDS A TOKEN.
# Round 3 trusted the gate's own SKIP TOKEN. The pinned regex admitted
# `milestones=skipped:… refs=skipped:…`, so removing ONLY the live GitHub walk
# from tools/roadmap_check.sh and dressing it as a named skip
# (`gh_authenticated() { return 1; }`) passed this section ON AN AUTHENTICATED
# BOX (round-4 blind critic, Fable) — the round-1 mutation in a new hat. Worse,
# NO automated lane could do anything but skip: no `run_all_tests.sh` step
# exported a token, the dev image had no `gh`, the macOS runner's `gh` is
# unauthenticated, and the daily audit ran only the labels gate. "CI 31/31
# green" measured arm (a) of the roadmap gate while this section printed
# `population lines 3/3`. The milestone mirror was one nobody checked, which is
# what #1207 was filed about.
#
# So: this caller runs the SAME probe the gates run (tools/gh_probe.sh, one
# file, sourced by both), and when the probe succeeds the pins REQUIRE the live
# tokens — `milestones=gh-api:… refs=gh-api:… resolved=N skipped=0`, a
# `gh-api:` labels line with no `SKIPPED BY NAME` alternative, and
# `loader=pyyaml` whenever this caller's own `import yaml` succeeds. A
# skip-dressed live walk is then red BY NAME. When the probe fails, the named
# skip is accepted AND this caller prints its own line saying so, so the CI log
# records which lanes measured what. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `linux / gcc`
# job now exports `GH_TOKEN` and its dev image installs `gh`, so the live arms
# run on every push; the daily `issue-triage.yml` audit runs the roadmap gate
# too, with a `gh-api:`-only pin.
#
# WHAT THIS CALLER CAN AND CANNOT PROVE. It verifies that a gate printed a
# population line it could only have produced by RUNNING ITS LIVE ARM ON THIS
# LANE (token-pinned, against this caller's own probe), and that the gate's
# selftest ran with the pinned count. A gate that FABRICATES its own output —
# printing the three literal lines and the selftest line with no work behind
# them — is outside this caller's power: a forged receipt reads exactly like a
# true one, and a caller measured 10/10 against one (round-4 blind critic,
# Fable, mutation M4). That is what the blind-critic rounds and each gate's own
# transverse mutations are for. The section still REQUIRES the live token, so a

# step, not a CI one.  What runs here is the rest, and it is not decoration:
# every converted guard must still raise under EIGS_STRICT, must raise FROM ITS
# OWN GUARD (a probe that raises elsewhere scored as coverage until this check
# existed — one probe named a builtin that does not exist and passed on
# "undefined variable"), every documented ANSWER must stay quiet, and every
# guard must have a probe.
# RUN ONCE, REPORT THAT RUN. The first version threw the failing run's output
# away (`>/dev/null`) and re-ran the tool to produce a diagnostic — so the
# evidence printed under a FAIL banner came from a DIFFERENT run, and if the
# failure was not deterministic the diagnostic was green. That is not a
# hypothetical: a full-suite log from 2026-09-06 shows this section printing
# "FAIL: a guard went silent..." followed by a completely clean report ending
# in "OK", which is unreadable and untriageable — the one run that knew what
# happened was discarded. Capture once; print what THAT run said.
# THE HARNESS FIRST (#1120). Every verdict that tool prints is a string match,
# and several of them were spelled `printf ... | grep -q`, which under
# `set -o pipefail` reports a FAILED match whenever the reader exits early and
# the writer is still writing: grep -q matches, closes the pipe, printf takes
# SIGPIPE, and the pipeline's status is 141. That flaked THIS section red on a
# green tree — measured 18 times in 186 runs under load with the pipe form in
# place — and the accusation it printed ("raised by the wrong guard") was
# refuted by the diagnostic two lines below it, which contained the guard's own
# message. --selftest pins the fork-free matchers that replaced it and
# reproduces the race deterministically, so the regression cannot return
# quietly. It measures the script, not the build: ~0.1s, no binary needed.

# timeout-failure line, add its declared count to FAIL and nothing to PASS — and
# THAT inner failure is inverted into exactly one ordinary suite PASS here.

# so its PASS/FAIL/TOTAL mutations are isolated: the child starts them at 0 and
# echoes the deltas, we assert on those deltas, and CONVERT — the live counters
# never absorbed the inner FAIL, so instead of unwinding it we simply credit one
# self-test PASS. The child runs under the self-test's OWN outer bound (10s,
# same timeout/gtimeout binary the guard detected) so a broken/removed guard
# converts to a clean, counted self-test FAILURE within that bound rather than
# hanging the whole suite. Tally exactness is load-bearing: a guard that fires
# but miscounts (inner FAIL delta != declared count, or PASS delta != 0) makes

# [99i3] ILP32 syntax gate (brief named this [99k]; that label is taken by
# CRLF #880). pages.yml compiles the playground with emcc (wasm32); a
# 64-bit-only sizeof(data)==sizeof(fn) assert kept that lane red from #1185.
# The gate runs clang -m32 -fsyntax-only over every translation unit the
# playground recipe hands the compiler. That population is the RECORDED ARGV
# of a stand-in compiler put first on PATH while the real web/build.sh runs in
# a scratch sandbox — not a reading of the script — and it is CLASSIFIED by
# the filesystem, not by a model of emcc's option grammar. Four rounds in a
# row a blind critic found a spelling the previous round's rule missed: a
# src/*.c filter; a `.c`-token audit blind to quoting, `$(...)`, variables and
# `.cc`; then a hand-typed operand table that dropped the TU after `--emrun`
# (a flag emcc takes NO operand for), never expanded an `@response-file` and
# could not see `-x c -`. So the rule is now "an existing regular file the
# compiler did not write, with a C-family suffix", cross-checked against the
# real clang driver's own `-x c` inputs; the gate examines the UNION and goes
# red by name when the two derivations disagree. The RECORDER keeps EVERY
# invocation, not the last one: round 5's stand-in truncated its records, so a
# recipe that compiled a planted `#error` unit in a first `-c` call and linked
# it in a second printed `OK: examined 23` while the real target was RED.
# Compile-then-link is the canonical build shape; the population is now the
# UNION over every recorded call, reported as `N call(s) recorded`, and a
# recipe with zero calls is FAIL by name. The driver cross-check is fed only
# operands the driver can OPEN: emcc's documented spaced form
# `-s TOTAL_MEMORY=64MB` made clang answer `no such file or directory` and
# this gate called a buildable recipe RED, so an operand the driver itself
# names as unopenable is dropped and REPORTED on `classifier: dropped=`, while
# one whose suffix is a `.c` stays FAIL by name. The -D/-U set is DERIVED the
# same way: both worlds' predefines are read with `-E -dM` (target
# `--target=wasm32-unknown-emscripten`, host `-m32`), every difference in NAME
# and in VALUE is reconciled, which values glibc refuses is MEASURED, and
# defined-ness parity is asserted for every macro any conditional in the
# population tests. EXACTLY ONE case SKIPs, and it is COUNTED on the RESULTS
# line: a C library with no 32-bit target for its own headers, saying so in
# its own words (`#error Unsupported architecture` on the macOS SDK), at
# whichever of the two stages it says so: macos-latest's availability probe
# PASSES and the SDK refuses only once the reconciliation has replaced
# `__i386__`/`__APPLE__`, so the same diagnostic decides at both. Round 5
# skipped on ANY probe failure and a blind critic reached that branch four
# ways on a LINUX box — no compiler on PATH, the gate's own `gnu/stubs-32.h`
# deleted, the system include directory pointing nowhere, and a broken
# reconciliation derivation whose diagnostic is glibc's, not an SDK's — each
# exiting 0 with `TOTAL=0` and no tally anywhere. All four are FAIL by name
# now, and the reconciled-world refusal runs its control (the same headers
# WITHOUT the reconciliation) before deciding either way, in the live path
# rather than in --selftest.

# [99aa] No pipeline decides a verdict under pipefail (#1122; mechanism #1120).
# `printf '%s' "$s" | grep -q "$pat"` under `set -o pipefail` is a race: grep -q
# exits on the first match and closes the read end, the still-writing printf
# takes SIGPIPE and exits 141, and pipefail reports the PIPELINE as 141 — a
# failed match — while grep matched. The test then goes red printing the very
# bytes it says are missing. This gate is static: it scans every .sh that
# enables pipefail and fails on any early-exiting reader at the end of a pipe
# whose STATUS picks a branch. File-reading greps, `grep -c`, `grep -vxF -f`
# and diagnostic `| head` are all left alone, and --selftest proves both halves
# of that — it FIRES on each banned spelling and stays QUIET on each legitimate
# one. NOTE: run_all_tests.sh itself does not set pipefail, so its ~173
# `| grep -q` sites are not exposed and are not subjects.
#
# Both halves are reported separately, and the self-test's check COUNT is
# pinned rather than tested for ">0" — "at least one check passed" is satisfied
# by a gate reduced to a single echo (the [99o] lesson).
