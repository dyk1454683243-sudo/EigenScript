# EigenScript

A complete, standalone programming language with native observer semantics,
OS-thread concurrency (`spawn`/`channel`/`thread_join`, with a documented
memory model in [docs/CONCURRENCY.md](docs/CONCURRENCY.md) — *values* copy
through a channel, while closures and `buffer`/`text_builder` HANDLES are
shared by reference, the last of which is the open defect
[#1148](https://github.com/InauguralSystems/EigenScript/issues/1148) under
[#1153](https://github.com/InauguralSystems/EigenScript/issues/1153)),
a 47-widget GUI toolkit, embedded database, tensor math,
and a 78-module standard library (17 STEM) — all in a single zero-dependency C binary.

## Try it in your browser

**[inauguralsystems.github.io/EigenScript/playground](https://inauguralsystems.github.io/EigenScript/playground/)** —
WASM build of the interpreter; no install, runs entirely client-side.
JIT/networking/subprocess are compiled out, everything else is the
same runtime that ships in the CLI.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InauguralSystems/EigenScript.git
cd EigenScript
./install.sh
```

This builds a ~940K minimal binary and installs it to `~/.local/bin/eigenscript`.

Requires only `gcc` — no external dependencies.
Run `./install.sh full` to also build the optional HTTP/DB/model binary
(`eigenscript-full`); that path requires PostgreSQL development headers.

**Homebrew** (macOS + Linux):

```bash
brew install InauguralSystems/eigenscript/eigenscript
```

**Docker** (linux/amd64):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" ghcr.io/inauguralsystems/eigenscript:latest program.eigs
```

Image tags: `:latest`, `:X.Y.Z`, `:X.Y`, `:X` for releases; `:edge` tracks `main`.

## Run

```bash
eigenscript program.eigs    # run a script
eigenscript                 # interactive REPL (history, arrow keys, tab completion)
eigenscript --version
```

## The Language

```eigenscript check
# Variables
x is 42
name is "hello"

# Functions with named parameters
define add(a, b) as:
    return a + b

print of (add of [3, 4])

# String interpolation
print of f"Hello {name}, x is {x}"

# Loops
for i in range of 10:
    print of i

# Lists
items is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print of (len of items)

# Conditionals
if x > 0:
    print of "positive"

# Dictionaries
person is {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print of person.name

# Closures
define make_adder(n) as:
    define inner(x) as:
        return x + n
    return inner

add5 is make_adder of 5
print of (add5 of 10)    # 15

# Error handling
try:
    result is risky_operation of data
catch e:
    print of f"Error: {e}"
```
```output
7
Hello hello, x is 42
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
5
positive
Alice
15
Error: {"kind": "undefined_name", "message": "undefined variable 'risky_operation'", "line": 41}
```

### Ask Your Code

Every value quietly remembers how it has been changing — and you don't pay
for it until you ask. Six questions, in plain English:

At the REPL, where an interrogative displays its answer:

```
$ eigenscript
eigs> signal is 10
eigs> signal is 14
eigs> signal is 15

eigs> what is signal     => 15        — the value now
eigs> who is signal      => signal    — the name you gave it
eigs> when is signal     => 3         — how many times it has been set
eigs> where is signal    => 0.337…    — how much information it carries
eigs> why is signal      => -0.016…   — how fast that information is changing
```

In a script an interrogative is an expression, so use it where a value
goes — `print of (what is signal)`, `if (when is signal) > 2:`. A bare
`what is signal` as a statement is refused (`E004`) wherever its answer
would be **discarded** — which is everywhere except the last statement of
its block, the one position nothing pops. Don't lean on that position:
`--lint` flags the bare form (`W019`) in both:

```eigenscript check
signal is 10
signal is 14
signal is 15
print of (what is signal)
print of (when is signal)
```
```output
15
3
```

(`how` is the sixth interrogative; see the observer guide for its current
semantics.)

The runtime also classifies each value's trajectory, so a value can tell
you when it has settled instead of you writing epsilon checks by hand:

```eigenscript check
loss is 50.0
steps is 0
loop while not converged:     # exits on its own once loss settles
    loss is loss * 0.5
    unobserved:
        steps is steps + 1    # unobserved, so the bare predicate keeps reading loss
print of (report of loss)
print of steps
print of loss
```

```output
converged
35
1.4551915228366852e-09
```

```eigenscript fragment
reading is 5.0
reading is 2.0
reading is 5.0
reading is 2.0
reading is 5.0
reading is 2.0
report of reading             # "oscillating"  (needs a few periods to classify)
```

Trajectory states: `converged`, `stable`, `equilibrium`, `oscillating`,
`improving`, `diverging` — handy for convergence detection, instability
alerts, or debugging without writing logging code.

The everyday payoff before any theory: `loop while not converged` deletes the
epsilon / remembered-previous / max-iteration boilerplate every numeric loop in
Python or JS hand-rolls — see
[docs/COMPARISON.md → Convergence loops](docs/COMPARISON.md#convergence-loops-boilerplate-you-stop-writing).

> **What `improving` and the rest actually mean.** For numbers the
> trajectory words read the value's own motion (#861): `converged` is the
> standard stopping criterion — steps settled under a tolerance — and
> `improving` means the steps are contracting toward a limit. For
> non-numeric values the observer's entropy reading applies — a value

> N-step window) are in [docs/PREDICATES.md](docs/PREDICATES.md).

### Don't Ask — `unobserved`

The observer runs on every assignment so interrogations are always
cheap. When you know a hot region won't be interrogated, opt out:

```eigenscript fragment i=0 n=3 acc=0 weights=[1,2,3] xs=[1,1,1]
unobserved:
    loop while i < n:
        acc is acc + weights[i] * xs[i]
        i is i + 1
```

Inside the block, assignments to plain variables skip the observer's
entropy walk and mutate the existing `Value` in place. Outside, normal
behavior resumes. Measured 2.7x on a 2M-iteration accumulator loop
(834ms → 307ms, n=5 medians); iLambdaAi saw ~22% end-to-end on an
18-hour training run. A scalar assignment inside the block still drops its
O(1) sample into the value window (#1049), so the verdicts `report` and the
predicates give a numeric binding are the same with the block as without
it — only the entropy channel (`why`/`how`, the dH window) is elided.

The block only helps **plain variables** — `x is ...`. A dict field or
list element (`d.k is ...`, `xs[i] is ...`) is never observed in the
first place, and is already mutated in place, so wrapping one buys
nothing; `--lint` flags a block with no plain-variable assignments as
W020. Note the depth is global rather than lexical: a function *called*
inside the block runs unobserved too.

Because the depth is dynamic, an interrogation inside the block — or
inside anything it calls — has no trajectory to classify. Rather than
answer `false` forever, **an observer predicate raises inside an
`unobserved:` block** (#871):

```
Error line 4: converged: the observer is off inside an 'unobserved:'
block, so this predicate has no trajectory to classify — the block's
depth is dynamic, so it also covers functions called from inside it
```

That is what keeps the annotation a *performance* knob: it cannot
silently change an answer. Before it raised, wrapping a call in
`unobserved:` made a settle loop return `-1` instead of `22`, and a bare
`loop while not converged` inside one never terminated at all — the
predicate could not become true, and the stall backstop that would have
ended the loop is gated on the same depth.

### Tensor Math

```eigenscript fragment input='zeros of [1, 8]'
w is random_normal of [8, 32, 0.1]
h is matmul of [input, w]
h is leaky_relu of h
probs is softmax of h
```

Builtins: `matmul`, `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `softmax`,
`log_softmax`, `relu`, `leaky_relu`, `zeros`, `random_normal`, `shape`,
`numerical_grad`, `sgd_update`, `tensor_save`, `tensor_load`.

Each of them takes a nested list, a flat list, or a flat numeric **`buffer`**,
and returns a buffer when every tensor operand was one. `zeros of n` returns a
buffer (`zeros of [rows, cols]` still returns the nested list) — numeric work
wants the flat container, and that is the name it reaches for.

EigenScript numbers are finite by construction. Operations that would create
`NaN` return `0`; operations that would overflow to infinity saturate at
`+/-1e308`; domain-limited functions clamp their inputs where appropriate
(`asin`, `acos`) or return a boundary value (`sqrt of -1` -> `0`).

### Arena Memory

```eigenscript fragment
arena_mark of null       # save allocation point
# ... compute gradients, intermediates ...
arena_reset of null      # reclaim all transient allocations
```

Bounded computation for constrained environments. Values that escape the
scope are safe: anything stored into a binding or a container that
outlives the window is promoted to the heap at the store (#873) — the
arena reclaims only the unstored intermediates.

The table above has 60 module rows. The other 18 files in `lib/` are the
`lib/ui_*.eigs` **fragments of `lib/ui.eigs`**, composed by it rather than
imported directly, so they have no row of their own; together they make up the
78-module standard library in the headline. `tools/docs_claims_check.sh`
derives all three numbers and fails if they stop adding up.

```eigenscript fragment
load_file of "lib/list.eigs"
define double as:                        # functions take one argument, n
    return n * 2
doubled is map of [[1, 2, 3], double]    # [2, 4, 6]
```

File loading is relative to the containing file, then the `eigs_modules` walk,
then the nearest `eigs.json` project root, then stdlib locations; absolute paths
are used as-is. There is no process cwd search. The REPL (including piped input)
and the embed API without a file path use their working directory as the base.
Add `eigs.json` at the root
when subdirectory files use root-relative paths. See the exact
[shared import/load_file resolution chain](docs/SPEC.md#modules).


See [docs/STDLIB.md](docs/STDLIB.md) for the full library guide — start at
its **"Finding Things"** index ("I need to..." → module) so you reach for
`stats.median` or `data.df_group_by` instead of hand-rolling it.

## Packages

Third-party packages are git repos consumable via the built-in
package tool:

```bash
eigenscript --pkg add alice/vecmath https://github.com/alice/eigs-vecmath v1.2.0
eigenscript --pkg install      # reproduce eigs_modules/ from the lockfile
eigenscript --pkg verify       # re-hash trees against the lockfile
```

Package identifiers are `<owner>/<name>` from the start — bare names
are reserved (the tool rejects them) so the namespace can't get
fragmented by a popularity spike. The disk layout and the
`import <name>` form stay flat (the leaf), so the example above is
`import vecmath` in user code.

`--pkg add` clones the repo into `eigs_modules/<name>/`, records the
resolved commit in `eigs.lock.json`, and the consumer can then
`import <name>`. No code from the dep runs at install time — only
the `import` does. Force-pushed tags can't sneak a different tree
past `--pkg install` (the lockfile pins a commit SHA, and `verify`
catches working-tree tampering).

## Embedding

EigenScript can be embedded in a C/C++ host. The public API is in
`src/eigs_embed.h` — opaque handles for the interpreter and per-thread
context, REPL-style source eval, error retrieval, ref-counted value
handles, and FFI registration for calling host functions from script:

```c
#include "eigs_embed.h"

static EigsValue *host_add(EigsValue *arg) {
    EigsValue *a = eigs_value_list_get(arg, 0);
    EigsValue *b = eigs_value_list_get(arg, 1);
    double sum = eigs_value_as_num(a) + eigs_value_as_num(b);
    eigs_value_release(a);
    eigs_value_release(b);
    return eigs_value_new_num(sum);
}

int main(void) {
    EigsState *st = eigs_open();
    eigs_register_function("host_add", host_add);

    EigsValue *r = eigs_eval_string("host_add of [3, 4]");
    printf("%g\n", eigs_value_as_num(r));   /* 7 */
    eigs_value_release(r);

    eigs_close(st);
}
```

The runtime is multi-state: a single process can host multiple `EigsState`
instances concurrently, each with its own global env, JIT cache, module
cache, and observer thresholds. The contract test in `src/embed_smoke.c`
(run with `make embed-smoke`) is the worked example.

## Examples

Ordered as a learning path:

```bash
eigenscript examples/hello.eigs       # printing
eigenscript examples/basics.eigs      # variables, functions, loops, strings
eigenscript examples/fizzbuzz.eigs    # conditionals and modular arithmetic

eigenscript examples/json_config.eigs # JSON data processing
eigenscript examples/stdlib_demo.eigs  # standard library (map, filter, reduce)
eigenscript examples/data_pipeline.eigs # combining libraries for real work
eigenscript examples/observer.eigs    # observer semantics (entropy, dH)
eigenscript examples/tensors.eigs     # tensor math, gradients, SGD

# STEM simulations
eigenscript examples/stem/orbital_mechanics.eigs   # Kepler orbits via RK4

eigenscript examples/stem/genetic_drift.eigs       # Wright-Fisher population genetics
eigenscript examples/stem/signal_analysis.eigs     # DFT frequency detection
eigenscript examples/stem/greenhouse_controller.eigs # closed-loop STEM controller
```

## Test Suite

```bash
cd tests
./run_all_tests.sh    # 263 test sections (minimal build; full build adds HTTP/DB/model suites)
```

### Writing your own tests

For your own projects, the `--test` runner is the convention. Write
`test_*.eigs` files that use the assertion library and end with
`test_summary`:

```eigs
load_file of "lib/test.eigs"
assert_eq of [2 + 2, 4, "arith"]
assert_true of [1 < 2, "ordering"]
test_summary of null
```

```bash
eigenscript --test                 # run every test_*.eigs in ./tests (or cwd)
eigenscript --test path/to/dir     # run a specific directory
eigenscript --test a.eigs b.eigs   # run specific files
eigenscript --test --json          # machine-readable results (for CI)
```

Each file runs in its own interpreter process (isolated assertion
state). A file passes iff it exits 0; the runner aggregates the per-file
pass/fail counts and exits nonzero if any file failed.

## Stability

EigenScript is pre-1.0. The compatibility surface is exactly what
[docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md) documents: every construct there carries a
runnable example whose output CI verifies on every commit, so a change
in documented behavior cannot land without rewriting the spec in the
same PR. Within the 0.x series, patch releases (0.x.**y**) never change
documented behavior; minor releases (0.**x**) may, and any such break
is listed in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under the release that made
it. Anything *not* in the spec — observer internals, bytecode layout,
JIT behavior, trace-tape format, extension builtins (`http`/`model`/
`db`/`gfx`) — may change in any release. At 1.0 the documented surface
freezes and semantic versioning applies from then on.

## Contributing

EigenScript is solo-maintained today and unpaid. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the build/test gates and how
to file PRs, and [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for how decisions
get made and how contributors can earn commit access over time.

## Editor Support

- **VS Code**: [`editors/vscode/`](editors/vscode/) — syntax
  highlighting, f-string interpolation, bracket/indent rules, **and** a
  bundled client that auto-launches the `eigenlsp` language server
  (`./install.sh` puts it on your `PATH`). Symlink it into
  `~/.vscode/extensions/` or package with `vsce`.
- **Vim / Neovim**: [`editors/vim/`](editors/vim/) — copy into
  `~/.vim/` or `~/.config/nvim/`.
- **Any LSP client**: `make lsp` builds `src/eigenlsp` (lint + syntax
  diagnostics, completion, hover, go-to-definition, find-references,
  document & workspace symbols, formatting, rename, code actions, and
  semantic tokens over stdio).
- On github.com, `.eigs` files render with Python highlighting (closest
  match) until a Linguist grammar is upstreamed.

## Build from Source

```bash
make                  # build
make test             # build and run the full suite (263 test sections)
make gfx              # build with SDL2 graphics (UI toolkit, games)
make net              # build with raw TCP sockets (record/replay-able)
make install          # install to ~/.local/bin
make clean            # remove build artifacts
```

Or use the shell scripts directly: `./build.sh` and `./install.sh`.

The minimal binary is a single C program with no runtime dependencies.

### Develop in a container

A [devcontainer](.devcontainer/) provides the full toolchain (gcc, clang,
`libpq-dev`, a PostgreSQL sidecar for the `ext_db` tests) with one click —
**Code ▸ Codespaces ▸ Create**, or the badge above. It pins `linux/amd64` so
the x86-64 JIT is exercised, not silently skipped. The same image backs CI's
Linux legs (`ci.yml` runs them `container:`-side), so a green build in a
Codespace and a green CI run can't drift.
